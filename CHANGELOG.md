# Changelog

## 1.0.0

(This release is the one from the canonical lauch onstage in Bogota. We were missing semantic versioning at the time, but we call this the 1.0.0 release retroactively.)

## 1.1.0

- Introduce semantic versioning to the Deployer and RToken
- `RTokenCreated` event: added `version` argument

```
event RTokenCreated(
        IMain indexed main,
        IRToken indexed rToken,
        IStRSR stRSR,
        address indexed owner
    );

```

=>

```
event RTokenCreated(
        IMain indexed main,
        IRToken indexed rToken,
        IStRSR stRSR,
        address indexed owner,
        string version
    );

```

- Add `version()` getter on Deployer, Main, and all Components, via mix-in. To be updated with each subsequent release.
