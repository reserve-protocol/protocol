These are the address files produces and used by our deployment and verification scripts for our Mainnet Test deployment on 3 Oct 2022. 

Do *not* use these for any but testing purposes. The RToken deployment listed here, in particular, is only for purposes of validation and Etherescan verification, and cannot be safely used!

If you send or stake any tokens to these contracts, we expect them to be entirely unrecoverable!
