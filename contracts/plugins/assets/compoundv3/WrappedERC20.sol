/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This is a "soft-fork" of Open Zeppelin's ERC20 contract but with some notable
 * changes including:
 *
 *   - The allowance system is changed so that users are either allowed or not.
 *   There are no approved/allowed amounts. `approve` function still exists to
 *   adhere to the ERC-20 interface.
 *
 *   - Adds `allow` for easier authorization and is an easier-to-use alternative
 *   to `approve`.
 *
 *   - All hooks are removed except for `_beforeTokenTransfer` in `_transfer`.
 *   This is done to save on gas.
 *
 *   - All reverts use custom errors instead of strings. Another gas-optimization.
 *
 *   - Adds `hasPermission` which works the same as `allowance` and checks whether
 *   a user is authorized to make balance transfers.
 *
 *   - Some state variables are removed in anticipation of this contract
 *   being inherited by the cUSDCv3 wrapper
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
