# Ethena USDe Collateral Plugin

## Summary

`USDe` is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that derives its value from a delta-neutral basis trade based on funding rates: long ETH-LSD + short ETH. This combined position captures the funding rate on perpetual exchanges, which has been historically positive throughout cryptoâ€™s history, which is also used to provision an additional `sUSDe` token.

This plugin allows `sUSDe` holders to use their tokens as collateral in the Reserve Protocol.

`sUSDe` is a high-yield (today) ERC4626 vault, most similar to the DAI savings module. The redeemable USDe amount can be obtained by dividing `sUSDe.totalAssets()` by `sUSDe.totalSupply()`.
