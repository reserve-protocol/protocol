/**
 * @title IStRSR
 * @notice An ERC20 token representing shares of the RSR over-collateralization pool.
 *
 * StRSR permits the BackingManager to take RSR in times of need. In return, the BackingManager
 * benefits the StRSR pool with RSR rewards purchased with a portion of its revenue.
 *
 * In the absence of collateral default or losses due to slippage, StRSR should have a
 * monotonically increasing exchange rate with respect to RSR, meaning that over time
 * StRSR is redeemable for more RSR. It is non-rebasing.
