/**
 * This spell is used by reweightable RTokens with rev 4.0.0 or later.
 *
 * This allows governance to normalize the basket by price at the time of setting it in place,

 *
 * Before casting `setNormalizedBasket` function this contract must have `MAIN_OWNER_ROLE` of Main,
 * and should also revoke the said role at the end of the transaction.
 *
 * The spell function should be called by the timelock owning Main. Governance should NOT
 * grant this spell ownership without immediately executing the spell function after.
