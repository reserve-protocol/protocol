# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Reserve Core smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between July 29â€”August 19 2024.

Following the C4 audit, 4 wardens ([RadiantLabs](https://code4rena.com/@RadiantLabs) ([3docSec](https://code4rena.com/@3docSec) and [EV\_om](https://code4rena.com/@EV_om)), [ether\_sky](https://code4rena.com/@ether_sky) and [Bauchibred](https://code4rena.com/@Bauchibred)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues; the [mitigation review report](#mitigation-review) is appended below the audit report.

# Medium Risk Findings (7)
## [[M-01] RToken can manipulate distribution to avoid paying DAO fees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/53)
*Submitted by [RadiantLabs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/53)*

Revenue produced by RTokens is sold for both RSR and RTokens according to a distribution defined in the [`Distributor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol). The `BackingManager` [splits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L247-L261) the collateral tokens to be sold proportionately to the RSR/RToken distribution ratio and sends them to the `rsrTrader` and `rTokenTrader`. When trades settle, the obtained RSR or RTokens are sent to the `Distributor`, which distributes them no longer according to the RSR/RToken ratio but to the different destinations for the specific token. The sum of all destinations for each token is used to derive the ratio.

The DAO fee is added to the RSR share of the initial split and paid when RSR is distributed.

However, the current implementation allows governance to manipulate the distribution settings without much effort in a way that can significantly reduce the amount of DAO fees paid.

This can be achieved through a combination of two different root causes:

*   an RSR destination can be added that prevents rewards from being immediately distributed
*   the RSR/RToken ratio is calculated twice: once in the  `BackingManager`, and once in the `Distributor`, and it is can be modified between the two

Essentially, the distribution can be set in a way that temporarily accumulates RSR revenue in in the `rsrTrader` according to one RSR/RToken ratio, and then later redistributed with a different ratio.

### Impact

RTokens can avoid paying most of the DAO fee

### Proof of Concept

Assuming a 10% DAO fee, governance can execute the following steps to pay only about 1% in fees:

1.  Set the distribution such that `rsrTotal == 0` before DAO fees [are added](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L221).
2.  Add the RSR token itself as a distribution target. Like stRSR, [RSR](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70#code) does not allow transferring to itself, so the distribution will always fail.
3.  10% of revenue will accumulate as RSR in the `rsrTrader`.
4.  After some time, change the distribution such that `rTokenTotal == 0` and add another destination with non-zero `rsrDist` (e.g., `stRSR`).
5.  Remove RSR as a distribution target and call `rsrTrader.distributeTokenToBuy()`.
6.  Only 10% of the accumulated RSR will go to the DAO, which is effectively 1% of the total revenue.
7.  Repeat this process as needed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disallowing RSR as a distribution token prevents this to a large extent.

## [[M-02] Broken assumptions can lead to the inability to seize RSR](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/39)
*Submitted by [krikolkk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/39)*

The `seizeRSR` [function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L424) takes RSR from the staking contract when `BackingManager` wants to sell RSR, [but it does not have enough](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L161). In this case, the stakers can lose a portion of their stake in order to keep the system healthy. However, an issue arises from broken assumptions about `stakeRSR` and `totalStakes`, which will make the contract unable to seize due to revert.

### Proof of Concept

Let's assume the system becomes unhealthy, and the stakers will start unstaking their tokens in fear of an upcoming reset/seize. Then, the expected event comes, and the `BackingManager` tries to seize RSR from the staking contract.

This action is frontran however, with the last staker who:

1.  unstakes everything
2.  stakes one token
3.  stakes one token again

Let's examine how does this break `seizeRSR`.

1.  During the `unstake` [call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L259):
    *   `_payoutRewards` is called. Since `totalStakes` is still above `1e18`, `stakeRSR` can be increased and become greater than `totalStakes`. Let's assume that `totalStakes` would be `1000e18` and `stakeRSR` would end at `1001e18` after this step.
    *   Now, the `stakeRate` would be updated. Since `stakeRSR` is not zero yet, and so is not `totalStakes`, it would be set to
        ```Solidity
          uint192((totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR)
        ```
        which translates to
        ```Solidity
          uint192((1000e18 * 1e18 + (1001e18 - 1)) / 1001e18)
        ```
        resulting in `999000999000999001`
    *   `totalStakes` would be decreased in `_burn` by `1000e18` to zero, which would result in `stakeRSR` being set to zero
2.  During the `stake` [call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L227):
    *   `payoutRewards` is skipped because it was already called in this block
    *   `newTotalStakes` in `mintStakes` is calculated as `(stakeRate * newStakeRSR) / FIX_ONE`, which translates to `(stakeRate * (stakeRSR + rsrAmount)) / FIX_ONE` which translates to `(999000999000999001 * (0 + 1)) / 1e18` resulting in 0, meaning 0 tokens are minted and `totalStakes` remains 0
    *   `stakeRSR` is increased by 1
3.  The second `stake` call will have the same effects
    *   after this call, the `stakeRate` is `999000999000999001`, `totalStakes` is 0, and `stakeRSR` is 2 (note that this breaks [this assumption](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L619-L620))
4.  Now we examine the important parts of the `seizeRSR` call
    *   `stakeRSRToTake` is set to `(2 * rsrAmount + (rsrBalance - 1)) / rsrBalance`, which will result in 1 every time the we are not seizing more than half of the total balance of the contract
    *   `stakeRSR` is therefore set to 1, and since it is non-zero, `stakeRate` is updated to `uint192((FIX_ONE_256 * totalStakes + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR)`, which translates to `uint192((1e18 * 0 + (1 - 1)) / 1)` which comes to 0
    *   the rest of the call is not important until it comes to
        ```Solidity
        emit ExchangeRateSet(initRate, exchangeRate());
        ```
    *   Here, we can see that the call returns
        ```Solidity
        return (FIX_SCALE_SQ + (stakeRate / 2)) / stakeRate;
        ```
    *   since `stakeRate` was updated to 0 before, the call will revert

### Impact and Likelihood

The likelihood of this issue is **LOW**. The impact seems somewhere between **HIGH** and **MEDIUM** since a necessary rebalance action can be DoSed until it is noticed and an action is taken. Considering that the issue is possible due to a broken invariant, the severity should be judged as **MEDIUM**.

### Recommendation

One way to fix the issue would be to enforce the invariant `if totalStakes == 0, then stakeRSR == 0`. This could be done by assuring that `amount` is not 0 in [`_mint`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L842).

```diff
    function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        _notZero(account);
+       _notZero(amount);
        assert(totalStakes + amount < type(uint224).max);

        stakes[era][account] += amount;
        totalStakes += amount;

        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
        _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
    }
```

Another mitigation could be to update the [`seizeRSR`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L446-L449) function to update the `stakeRate` only if both `stakeRSR` and `totalStakes` are non-zero or update the `stakeRate` to `FIX_ONE` if either of these two is zero.

## [[M-03] The default Governor Anastasius is unable to call `resetStakes`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/36)
*Submitted by [krikolkk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/36)*

The `StRSR` contract contains a function [`resetStakes`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L490), which is used to reset the staking of a specific RToken system, when the stake rate becomes unsafe. When this happens, the `era` of the staking contract is incremented, which practically resets the `StRSR` token. Since this is a sensitive action, only governance can call this function.

The Reserve team provides a default and recommended `Governance` contract with `TimelockController`, which handles the proposal creation and execution. The contract also ensures that proposals created in a past era can not be queued or executed in the current era since the voting conditions can differ between eras. However due to this check, it is impossible for the `Governance` contract to call `resetStakes`, since the function would increment the era, and the following check whether the proposal was proposed in the same era would not hold and revert the transaction.

### Proof of Concept

The following test added to [ZZStRSR.tests.ts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/test/ZZStRSR.test.ts) supports the issue:

<details>

```typescript
it.only("Impossible to reset stakes with Governor Anastasius", async () => {
  // Setup governance

### Impact and Likelihood

The impact of this issue is **MEDIUM**, as under usual conditions, an impactful governance action would be unavailable. Since the probability of the stake rates being over/under max/min safe stake rate is low ([as per inline docs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L489)), but the probability of the issue taking place is high, the likelihood of this issue is judged **MEDIUM**, hence the **MEDIUM** severity of this issue.

### Recommendation

Consider changing the order of `super._execute` and the `startedInSameEra` check in the [`Governance::_execute`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/plugins/governance/Governance.sol#L143-L144) function:

```diff
    function _execute(
        uint256 proposalId,
        address[] memory targets,
        uint256[] memory values,
        bytes[] memory calldatas,
        bytes32 descriptionHash
    ) internal override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) {
+       require(startedInSameEra(proposalId), "new era");
        super._execute(proposalId, targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);
-       require(startedInSameEra(proposalId), "new era");
    }
```

## [[M-04] Dutch auctions can fail to settle if any other collateral in the basket behaves unexpectedly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/32)
*Submitted by [RadiantLabs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/32)*

When a Dutch auction that originated from the backing manager receives a bid, it [calls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/plugins/trading/DutchTrade.sol#L222) `BackingManager.settleTrade()` to settle the auction immediately, which [attempts to chain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L92) into another `rebalance()` call. This chaining is implemented using a try-catch block that attempts to catch out-of-gas errors.

However, this pattern is not safe because empty error data does not always indicate an out-of-gas error. Other types of errors also return no data, such as calls to empty addresses casted as contracts and revert / require statements with no error message.

The `rebalance()` function interacts with multiple external assets and performs several operations that can throw empty errors:

1.  In `basketsHeldBy()`, which calls `_quantity()`, which in turn calls `coll.refPerTok()` (this function should in theory [never revert](https://github.com/3docSec/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/docs/collateral.md#refpertok-reftok), but in case it interacts with the underlying ERC20, its implementation may have been upgraded to one that does).
2.  In `prepareRecollateralizationTrade()`, which calls `basketRange()`, which also calls `_quantity()`.
3.  In `tryTrade()` if a new rebalancing trade is indeed chained, which calls `approve()` on the token via `AllowanceLib.safeApproveFallbackToMax()`. This is a direct interaction with the token and hence cannot be trusted, especially if the possibility of [upgradeability](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/tree/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf?tab=readme-ov-file#erc20-token-behaviors-in-scope) is considered.

If any of these operations result in an empty error, the auction settlement will fail. This can lead to the Dutch auction being unable to settle at a fair price.

Note: we have found [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-reserve-findings/issues/8) finding pointing out the very same issue in a previous audit, but this report highlights a different root cause in where the error originates.

### Impact

Dutch auctions may fail to settle at the appropriate price or at all.

### Proof of Concept

1.  A Dutch auction is initiated for rebalancing collateral.
2.  After some time, a bidder attempts to submit a bid at fair market value.
3.  `BackingManager.settleTrade()` is called by the trade contract.
4.  The `rebalance()` function is called within the try-catch block.
5.  The underlying ERC-20 of one of the collateral assets in the basket has an empty revert clause that currently throws when one of its functions is called.
6.  The catch block receives an empty error and reverts the transaction.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Avoid usage of this pattern to catch OOG errors in any functions that cannot revert and may interact with external contracts. Instead, in such cases always employ the [`_reserveGas()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L253) pattern that was iterated on to mitigate previous findings ([1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/254), [2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/73), [3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-reserve-findings/issues/7)) with a similar root cause. We have found no other instances in which this applies.

## [[M-05] Users can dodge losses due to StRSR era changes with instant operations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/21)
*Submitted by [RadiantLabs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/21)*

The StRSR contract implements an era-based wrapping of the `stakeRate` and `draftRate` exchange rates whenever these pass the maximum accepted value of `MAX_STAKE_RATE` and `MAX_DRAFT_RATE`; the effect of this action is that StRSR token holders see their balance reset (`stakeRate` reset) and/or all StRSR vesting withdraws are forgotten and the relative funds lost (`draftRate` reset).

From the code below, we can see that these two rates can be reset independently;

```Solidity
File: StRSR.sol
424:     function seizeRSR(uint256 rsrAmount) external {
---
440:         // Remove RSR from stakeRSR
441:         uint256 stakeRSRToTake = (stakeRSR * rsrAmount + (rsrBalance - 1)) / rsrBalance;
442:         stakeRSR -= stakeRSRToTake;
443:         seizedRSR = stakeRSRToTake;
444: 
445:         // update stakeRate, possibly beginning a new stake era
446:         if (stakeRSR != 0) {
447:             // Downcast is safe: totalStakes is 1e38 at most so expression maximum value is 1e56
448:             stakeRate = uint192((FIX_ONE_256 * totalStakes + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR);
449:         }
450:         if (stakeRSR == 0 || stakeRate > MAX_STAKE_RATE) {
451:             seizedRSR += stakeRSR;
452:             beginEra();
453:         }
454: 
455:         // Remove RSR from draftRSR
456:         uint256 draftRSRToTake = (draftRSR * rsrAmount + (rsrBalance - 1)) / rsrBalance;
457:         draftRSR -= draftRSRToTake;
458:         seizedRSR += draftRSRToTake;
459: 
460:         // update draftRate, possibly beginning a new draft era
461:         if (draftRSR != 0) {
462:             // Downcast is safe: totalDrafts is 1e38 at most so expression maximum value is 1e56
463:             draftRate = uint192((FIX_ONE_256 * totalDrafts + (draftRSR - 1)) / draftRSR);
464:         }
465: 
466:         if (draftRSR == 0 || draftRate > MAX_DRAFT_RATE) {
467:             seizedRSR += draftRSR;
468:             beginDraftEra();
469:         }
```

... and we'd then argue that they will most likely happen at different times, at the very least because rewards contribute to the evolution of `stakeRate` only.

In the event only one of the two rates reaches the cap and undergoes a reset, stakers can dodge the bullet of collectivized losses, by:

*   sandwiching the `stakeRate` wrapping with `unstake` and `cancelUnstake` calls
*   sandwiching the `draftRate` wrapping with `cancelUnstake` and `unstake` calls

### Impact

Users can avoid the collectivization of rate wrapping losses, and artificially get a share of any RSR left in the StRSR contract.

This latter quantity may be considerable, because while unlikely, it's not impossible that the rate wrapping happens when little RSR is seized from an otherwise large RSR balance in the StRSR contract.

### Proof of Concept

Alice is an StRSR token holder:

*   she notices that a transaction will soon cause RSR to be seized and the `stakeRate` will wrap to 1.0
*   she immediately initiates an `unstake`, so her funds are moved to the drafts bucket
*   immediately after the transaction that wraps the `stakeRate`, she calls `cancelUnstake`
*   Alice lost only the pro-rata RSR that was seized (which may be minimal) while others lost everything

A similar sequence can be performed to avoid losses on funds that are being unstaked by instead calling `cancelUnstake` first and `unstake` later.

### Tools Used

Code review, Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider wrapping both rates when at least one reaches the maximum.

However, the impact trades off directly against the likelihood: the further the rate is away from the 1e27 bounds, the less likely this case is to occur.

## [[M-06] The time available for a canceled withdrawal should not impact future unstaking processes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/18)
*Submitted by [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/18), also found by [Bauchibred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/120)*

### Lines of Code

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L279><br>

### Impact

When `stakers` want to `unstake` their `StRSR`, they cannot `withdraw` `RSR` immediately.<br>
Instead, each `withdrawal` enters a `queue` and will become available after the `unstaking delay` period.<br>
This `queue` operates on a `FIFO` basis, meaning earlier `withdrawals` are processed before later ones.<br>
`Stakers` can also cancel their `withdrawals`, and the `RSR` will be `restaked` immediately.<br>
However, even canceled `withdrawals` can still impact future `withdrawal` requests.

### Proof of Concept

Suppose the current `unstakingDelay` is set to `1 day`, and a user decides to `unstake` some amount of `StRSR` at time `T` (`line 279`).

    function unstake(uint256 stakeAmount) external {
    Â  Â  address account = _msgSender();
    Â  Â  require(stakes[era][account] >= stakeAmount, "insufficient balance");
    Â  Â  _payoutRewards();
    Â  Â  _burn(account, stakeAmount);

    Â  Â  uint256 newStakeRSR = (FIX_ONE_256 * totalStakes + (stakeRate - 1)) / stakeRate;
    Â  Â  uint256 rsrAmount = stakeRSR - newStakeRSR;
    Â  Â  stakeRSR = newStakeRSR;

    279:Â  Â  (uint256 index, uint64 availableAt) = pushDraft(account, rsrAmount);
    }

This request enters a `queue`, which we assume is empty at this point, making the `withdrawal` available at `T + 1 day` (`line 658`).

    function pushDraft(address account, uint256 rsrAmount)
    Â  Â  internal
    Â  Â  returns (uint256 index, uint64 availableAt)
    {
    Â  Â  CumulativeDraft[] storage queue = draftQueues[draftEra][account];
    Â  Â  index = queue.length;  // index = 0

    Â  Â  uint192 oldDrafts = index != 0 ? queue[index - 1].drafts : 0; // 0
    Â  Â  uint64 lastAvailableAt = index != 0 ? queue[index - 1].availableAt : 0; // 0
    658:Â  Â  availableAt = uint64(block.timestamp) + unstakingDelay; // T + 1 day

    Â  Â  if (lastAvailableAt > availableAt) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  availableAt = lastAvailableAt;
    Â  Â  }
    Â  Â  queue.push(CumulativeDraft(uint176(oldDrafts + draftAmount), availableAt));
    }

Now, let's assume the user `cancels` this `withdrawal` at time `T` for testing purposes. Instead of removing the `withdrawal` from the `queue`, we simply increase the `first available ID`, which is a good approach and is easy to implement (`line 368`).

    function cancelUnstake(uint256 endId) external {
    Â  Â  uint256 firstId = firstRemainingDraft[draftEra][account];
    Â  Â  CumulativeDraft[] storage queue = draftQueues[draftEra][account];
    Â  Â  if (endId == 0 || firstId >= endId) return;

    Â  Â  require(endId <= queue.length, "index out-of-bounds");

    368:Â  Â  firstRemainingDraft[draftEra][account] = endId;
    }

Even though the `queue` technically still contains one item (the `canceled` `withdrawal` request), we can consider the `queue` empty in terms of available `withdrawals`.

Later, the owner updates the `unstakingDelay` to `1 hour`.<br>
The user attempts to `unstake` again, expecting to `withdraw` just `1 hour` later, which should be possible.<br>
However, the canceled `withdrawal` still impacts this new request.

In `line 654`, the `index` is `1` , and in `line 657`, `lastAvailableAt` is set to `T + 1 day` due to the canceled `withdrawal`.<br>
As a result, in `line 658`, the `availableAt` for the new `withdrawal` is calculated as `T + 1 hour`, but since this is less than `T + 1 day`, the new `withdrawal` is also pushed to be available `1 day` later.

    function pushDraft(address account, uint256 rsrAmount)
    Â  Â  internal
    Â  Â  returns (uint256 index, uint64 availableAt)
    {
    Â  Â  CumulativeDraft[] storage queue = draftQueues[draftEra][account];
    654:Â  Â  index = queue.length;  // index = 1

    Â  Â  uint192 oldDrafts = index != 0 ? queue[index - 1].drafts : 0; // 0
    657:Â  Â  uint64 lastAvailableAt = index != 0 ? queue[index - 1].availableAt : 0; // T + 1 day
    658:Â  Â  availableAt = uint64(block.timestamp) + unstakingDelay; // T + 1 hour

    Â  Â  if (lastAvailableAt > availableAt) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  availableAt = lastAvailableAt;
    Â  Â  }
    Â  Â  queue.push(CumulativeDraft(uint176(oldDrafts + draftAmount), availableAt));
    }

This situation is clearly unfair to the user.

The `availableAt` of `canceled withdrawals` should not be considered when determining the availability of new `withdrawals`.

## [[M-07] The `tradeEnd` in `BackingManager` isn't updating correctly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/6)
*Submitted by [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/6), also found by [RadiantLabs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/119) and [stuart\_the\_minion](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve-findings/issues/104)*

### Lines of code

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L114><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L166>

### Impact

In the `BackingManager`, we use the `tradeEnd` value for each type of `trade` to prevent next `auction` from occurring within the same block. We can find a comment in the code explaining this in `line 114`.

    function rebalance(TradeKind kind) external nonReentrant {
    Â  Â  // DoS prevention:
    114:Â  Â  // unless caller is self, require that the next auction is not in same block
    Â  Â  require(
    Â  Â  Â  Â  _msgSender() == address(this) || tradeEnd[kind] < block.timestamp,
    Â  Â  Â  Â  "already rebalancing"
    Â  Â  );

This approach works correctly for `Batch auctions`. However, with `Dutch auctions`, the `tradeEnd` value can inadvertently block the next `auction` from starting for a certain period.

### Proof of Concept

The `maximum auction length` can be up to `1 week`.

    uint48 public constant MAX_AUCTION_LENGTH = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7; // {s} max valid duration, 1 week

And the `minimum warm-up period` in the `BasketHandler` is `1 minute`.

    uint48 public constant MIN_WARMUP_PERIOD = 60; // {s} 1 minute

Suppose a `Dutch auction` is created in the `BackingManager` with a length of `1 week` (`7 days`), starting at timestamp `T`. The `tradeEnd` for this `auction type` is set to `T + 7 days` in `line 166`.

    function rebalance(TradeKind kind) external nonReentrant {
    155:    if (doTrade) {

    165:	    ITrade trade = tryTrade(kind, req, prices);
    166:	    tradeEnd[kind] = trade.endTime(); // {s}

    168:	}
    }

Now, let's consider a scenario where one of the `assets` in the `basket` temporarily falls into an `IFFY` status. At this point, the current status of the `basket` is also `IFFY` (`line 323~325`).

    function status() public view returns (CollateralStatus status_) {
    	uint256 size = basket.erc20s.length;
    Â  Â  if (disabled || size == 0) return CollateralStatus.DISABLED;
    Â  Â  
    Â  Â  for (uint256 i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  CollateralStatus s = assetRegistry.toColl(basket.erc20s[i]).status();
    323:Â  Â  Â  Â  if (s.worseThan(status_)) {
    324:Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  if (s == CollateralStatus.DISABLED) return CollateralStatus.DISABLED;
    325:Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  status_ = s;
    Â  Â  Â  Â  }
    Â  Â  }
    }

The `auction` is settled one day later, triggering the `rebalance` function (`line 92`).

    function settleTrade(IERC20 sell) public override(ITrading, TradingP1) returns (ITrade trade) {
    Â  Â  delete tokensOut[sell];
    Â  Â  trade = super.settleTrade(sell); // nonReentrant

    Â  Â  if (_msgSender() == address(trade)) {Â  Â  Â  Â  
    92:Â  Â  Â  Â  try this.rebalance(trade.KIND()) {} catch (bytes memory errData) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  }
    Â  Â  }
    }

The check at `line 116` passes because the caller is the `BackingManager` itself. However, the `BasketHandler` status is still `IFFY`, meaning it isn't ready for a new `auction`. As a result, the check at `line 121` prevents the next `auction` from being created.

    function rebalance(TradeKind kind) external nonReentrant {
    Â  Â  requireNotTradingPausedOrFrozen();
    Â  Â  assetRegistry.refresh();

    Â  Â  require(
    116:Â  Â  Â  Â  _msgSender() == address(this) || tradeEnd[kind] < block.timestamp,
    Â  Â  Â  Â  "already rebalancing"
    Â  Â  );

    Â  Â  require(tradesOpen == 0, "trade open");
    Â  Â  
    121:Â  Â  require(basketHandler.isReady(), "basket not ready");
    Â  Â  
    Â  Â  require(block.timestamp >= basketHandler.timestamp() + tradingDelay, "trading delayed");
    }

The `tradeEnd` is still set to `T + 7 days` and the current time is now `T + 1 day`.

After another day, the `asset`'s status recovers to `SOUND`, and the `BasketHandler` status updates to `SOUND` as well.<br>
After the `warm-up period` (`1 minute` in our scenario), the `BasketHandler` is ready, and the time is now `T + 2 days + 1 minute`.<br>
At this point, we want to create a new `Dutch auction` for `rebalancing`.<br>
However, we can't create the next `Dutch auction` until `T + 7 days` due to the existing `tradeEnd`.

This delay clearly poses an issue.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```
    function settleTrade(IERC20 sell) public override(ITrading, TradingP1) returns (ITrade trade) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  delete tokensOut[sell];
    Â  Â  Â  Â  trade = super.settleTrade(sell); // nonReentrant

    Â  Â  Â  Â  if (_msgSender() == address(trade)) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  try this.rebalance(trade.KIND()) {} catch (bytes memory errData) {
    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  if (errData.length == 0) revert(); // solhint-disable-line reason-string
    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  }

    +			tradeEnd[kind] = uint48(block.timestamp);

    Â  Â  Â  Â  }
    Â  Â  }
    }
```

## [L-01] Asymmetric decay of Asset saved priced distorts average price

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/main/contracts/plugins/assets/Asset.sol#L150-L163

### Description

The Asset contract implements a graceful fallback for being able to provide underlying asset prices when the upstream oracle is unreachable.

This fallback uses the last known price, but artificially widens its range (`low-high`) to offset the uncertainty over the stale price.

The math of how this offset is done is implemented with this code;
```Solidity
File: Asset.sol
150:                 // Decay _high upwards to 3x savedHighPrice
151:                 // {UoA/tok} = {UoA/tok} * {1}
152:                 _high = savedHighPrice.safeMul(
153:                     FIX_ONE + MAX_HIGH_PRICE_BUFFER.muluDivu(delta - decayDelay, priceTimeout),
154:                     ROUND
155:                 ); // during overflow should not revert
156: 
157:                 // if _high is FIX_MAX, leave at UNPRICED
158:                 if (_high != FIX_MAX) {
159:                     // Decay _low downwards from savedLowPrice to 0
160:                     // {UoA/tok} = {UoA/tok} * {1}
161:                     _low = savedLowPrice.muluDivu(decayDelay + priceTimeout - delta, priceTimeout);
162:                     // during overflow should revert since a FIX_MAX _low breaks everything
163:                 }
```

We can see that when the decay starts (`delta == decayDelay`), the saved `high/low` readings are returned unchanged; then they start diverging linearly: at the end of the decay (left limit of `delta == decayDelay + priceTimeout`) `low` reaches `0` and `high` is scaled up by a multiplier of `FIX_ONE + MAX_HIGH_PRICE_BUFFER`, that is 3x its cached value.

Referring to [this chart](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/145972240/357833152-d4a42618-e03c-4f9b-ae95-61bb77bbd224.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAVCODYLSA53PQK4ZA%2F20240911%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240911T223748Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=71d369476874c7a35ef010db4a8a0c486a4f6ceba2e246eeeeb8862cea6c1382&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=0&key_id=0&repo_id=0), because the two values - `low` (blue)  and `high` (red) - diverge with a different slope, their average (`(low + high) / 2`, green) also varies over time and increases.

While this is not an issue for the Asset itself which doesn't directly combine the two values with an average, it can be for downstream contracts that may do.

Consider changing `MAX_HIGH_PRICE_BUFFER` to `FIX_ONE` instead.

## [L-02] "Flash" upgrade can be abused to create rigged but honest-looking RToken contracts

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/Main.sol#L111-L150

### Description

The Main contract offers the possibility to upgrade Main and Component implementations, fetching the target addresses from an external `versionRegistry` provider.

Because the Deployer doesn't set `versionRegistry` but let the contract admin provide it, and this entity can't always be trusted as it's specified in the permissionless `Deployer.deploy` function, the contract upgrade system can be abused to achieve a large variety of deviations from its intended behavior by:
- setting custom implementations
- tampering with the storage of all contracts (including balances and/or settings to bypass `init` sanity checks)
- restoring the contracts in a state that looks legitimate with proper implementations and governance

All of the above can be achieved in one single transaction (hence the "Flash upgrade" term used above), possibly to be bundled with the contract creation or buried in a long list of spammy interactions to lower the chances of detection; after a moderately sophisticated attack like [the one presented in PoC](https://gist.github.com/3docSec/1cf7037b38f72719326f0f59d3f787f2) there can be no signs of past wrongdoing in the result of any of the RToken contracts' getters.

Consider having the Deployer set `Main.versionRegistry` at RToken deployment time to enforce continued use of trusted code.

## [L-03] Prime basket weights are not properly validated

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L264

### Description

When the Governance sets the prime basket compositions, for each of the provided collaterals, it is allowed to specify any target amount between `1` and `MAX_TARGET_AMT` (L264):
```Solidity
File: BasketHandler.sol
260:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < erc20s.length; ++i) {
261:             // This is a nice catch to have, but in general it is possible for
262:             // an ERC20 in the prime basket to have its asset unregistered.
263:             require(assetRegistry.toAsset(erc20s[i]).isCollateral(), "erc20 is not collateral");
264:             require(0 < targetAmts[i] && targetAmts[i] <= MAX_TARGET_AMT, "invalid target amount");
265: 
266:             config.erc20s.push(erc20s[i]);
267:             config.targetAmts[erc20s[i]] = targetAmts[i];
268:             names[i] = assetRegistry.toColl(erc20s[i]).targetName();
269:             config.targetNames[erc20s[i]] = names[i];
270:         }
```

This check is however insufficient because excessively low values of `targetAmt`, like `1`, would likely cause overflows in the code that translates balances to assets / baskets like the BasketHandler.basketsHeldBy function.

Consider enforcing the [range specified in the acceptable values for prime basket weights](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/docs/solidity-style.md?plain=1#L105), at the very least by requiring `targetAmts` to be `1e-6 (D18)` or more instead of the `1e-18 (D18)` or more that is currently allowed.

## [L-04] RToken issuance/redemption throttles can be monopolized by Bundlers and Batchers

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L121-L122<br>
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L199-L200<br>
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L277-L278<br>

### Description

When the RToken issuance and redemption are close to their limits, every upcoming issuance and redemption creates opportunity for a new operation in opposite direction to happen in the form of restored amount available for redemption or issuance respectively.

This means that actors that can control the ordering of transactions, and/or when a transaction is executed, like MEV bundlers and gasless transaction batchers, will have the upper hand on using these available amounts, potentially monopolizing them for themselves.

We don't have a suggested mitigation for the contracts in the scope, but we'd rather issue a recommendation for users to use private mempools and avoid gasless transactions for operations involving RToken issuance and redemption.

## [L-05] Broker accepts `batchAuctionLength` and `dutchAuctionLength` to be both `0`

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/Broker.sol#L199<br>
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/Broker.sol#L221

### Description

When `Broker` is initialized, and later re-configured via `governance` calls, it validates the `batchAuctionLength` and `dutchAuctionLength` given parameters individually:

```Solidity
File: Broker.sol
073:     function init(
---
080:     ) external initializer {
---
101:         setBatchAuctionLength(batchAuctionLength_);
102:         setDutchAuctionLength(dutchAuctionLength_);
103:     }
---
197:     function setBatchAuctionLength(uint48 newAuctionLength) public governance {
198:         require(
199:             newAuctionLength == 0 ||
200:                 (newAuctionLength >= MIN_AUCTION_LENGTH && newAuctionLength <= MAX_AUCTION_LENGTH),
201:             "invalid batchAuctionLength"
202:         );
203:         emit BatchAuctionLengthSet(batchAuctionLength, newAuctionLength);
204:         batchAuctionLength = newAuctionLength;
205:     }
---
219:     function setDutchAuctionLength(uint48 newAuctionLength) public governance {
220:         require(
221:             newAuctionLength == 0 ||
222:                 (newAuctionLength >= MIN_AUCTION_LENGTH && newAuctionLength <= MAX_AUCTION_LENGTH),
223:             "invalid dutchAuctionLength"
224:         );
225:         emit DutchAuctionLengthSet(dutchAuctionLength, newAuctionLength);
226:         dutchAuctionLength = newAuctionLength;
227:     }
```

It does however not validate the situation when they are both provided as `0`. This is a situation that is not admissible because in this case, no auction can be created and a BasketManager can't open recollateralization trades.

Consider adding additional checks in `setBatchAuctionLength` and `setDutchAuctionLength` to prevent setting both to `0`.

## [L-06] `PermitLib` uses two different ERC1271 implementations for the same call

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/libraries/Permit.sol#L17

### Description

PermitLib offers the `requireSignature` function, which calls `isValidSignature` if `owner` is a contract, and uses OZ's `isValidSignatureNow` otherwise.

If we look at [the `isValidSignatureNow` implementation of the imported OZ version](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/2d081f24cac1a867f6f73d512f2022e1fa987854/contracts/utils/cryptography/SignatureCheckerUpgradeable.sol#L28), however, we can see that this, too, has a fallback call to `IERC1271.isValidSignature`.

The `if isContract` branch in `requireSignature` is therefore useless because it's redundant with the other, more standard, branch and we therefore recommend removing it.

## [L-07] `VersionRegistry.latestVersion()` does not support semantic versioning

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/registry/VersionRegistry.sol#L54

### Description

From the [version history of the Reserve protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/tags) it appears that the protocol is using semantic versioning or a similar alternative.

This seems a use case that does not fit well with how `VersionRegistry.latestVersion` is updated: every time a new version is registered on `VersionRegistry`,  `latestVersion` will point to that version.

In the event that the protocol releases `4.0.0` and shortly after `3.4.2`, then `latestVersion` will incorrectly point to `3.4.2`.

Consider adding a `boolean` flag to the `registerVersion` function, allowing the caller to specify whether `latestVersion` should be updated or not.

## [L-08] `DutchTrade.bidWithCallback()` does not send back excess tokens

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/plugins/trading/DutchTrade.sol#L260

### Description

`DutchTrade.bidWithCallback` allows for bidding with a callback hook that allows the bidder to swap the bought tokens for the sold tokens.

After the callback exits, the function checks that enough tokens are provided:

```Solidity
File: DutchTrade.sol
257:         uint256 balanceBefore = buy.balanceOf(address(this)); // {qBuyTok}
258:         IDutchTradeCallee(bidder).dutchTradeCallback(address(buy), amountIn, data);
259:         require(
260:             amountIn <= buy.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore,
261:             "insufficient buy tokens"
262:         );
```

However, if extra tokens are given, the function does not return the extras to the caller. Consider adding a check to return extra tokens if any are provided

## [L-09] Missing check to avoid circular dependencies among RTokens

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L166

### Description

When BasketHandler switches basket to new reference amounts, it calls `trackStatus()`:

```Solidity
File: BasketHandler.sol
158:     function refreshBasket() external {
159:         assetRegistry.refresh();
160: 
161:         require(
162:             main.hasRole(OWNER, _msgSender()) ||
163:                 (lastStatus == CollateralStatus.DISABLED && !main.tradingPausedOrFrozen()),
164:             "basket unrefreshable"
165:         );
166:         _switchBasket();
167: 
168:         trackStatus();
169:     }
```

This call sequence would not call the scenario when there is a circular dependency between RTokens, for example: 
- RTokenA has RTokenB as collateral
- RTokenB governance is is unaware of their token being a collateral in RTokenA
- RTokenB adds RTokenA as collateral

At this point, price retrieval of either collateral would fail because of an infinite recursion.<br>
While the RTokenB governance action can be seen as a mistake, RTokenA is affected too without any mistake made by its governance.

Consider adding a `price()` call after `trackStatus()` to trigger a failure in the above-mentioned case.

## [L-10] `StRSRVotes.delegateBySig()` misses check for delegation to happen in the era intended by the signer

### Links to affected code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/StRSRVotes.sol#L176

### Description

The `StRSRVotes.delegateBySig()` function allows a signer to delegate voting power to a designed delegate via a gasless call.

If we look at the logic that verifies the signature verification:

```Solidity
File: StRSRVotes.sol
166:     function delegateBySig(
167:         address delegatee,
168:         uint256 nonce,
169:         uint256 expiry,
170:         uint8 v,
171:         bytes32 r,
172:         bytes32 s
173:     ) public {
174:         require(block.timestamp <= expiry, "signature expired");
175:         address signer = ECDSAUpgradeable.recover(
176:             _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(_DELEGATE_TYPEHASH, delegatee, nonce, expiry))),
177:             v,
178:             r,
179:             s
180:         );
181:         require(nonce == _useDelegationNonce(signer), "invalid nonce");
182:         _delegate(signer, delegatee);
183:     }
```

We can see that the `era` is missing from the signed payload at L176.

This means that a delegation signature can be reused across era changes, despite balances and voting power no longer apply.

Consider adding an `era` field to the signed payload for `StRSRVotes.delegateBySig()`

## [L-11] Potential DAO fee rounding to zero for upgraded RTokens

Upgraded RTokens might not pay DAO fees even if `daoFeeRegistry` has been set in `Main`. This is due to the change in the distribution total constraint in the `_ensureSufficientTotal()` function.

In previous versions, the check only required one of `rTokenDist` or `rsrDist` to be non-zero. The current implementation requires their sum to be greater than or equal to `MAX_DISTRIBUTION`. RTokens initialized with small distribution values in previous versions might not meet this new constraint after upgrading.

For small `rTokenTotal` and `rsrTotal` values, the [DAO fee calculation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/blob/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L221-L223)in the `distribute()` function will round down to 0.

Consider implementing a post-upgrade call to `_ensureSufficientTotal()`.

## [L-12] Changing distributions between revenue split and distribution can affect DAO fee amounts

Building upon the issue identified in TRST-L-2 of the Trust Security audit report for v4.0.0, there are additional impacts related to changing distributions between when revenue is split in the `BackingManager` and when it's distributed in the `Distributor`:

1. If RToken governance alters the distribution to heavily favor `rsrTotal` over `rTokenTotal`, they can significantly reduce the effective DAO fee for that cycle.
2. If the DAO changes the fee percentage during this period, the RToken might end up paying more or less than would be fair for that cycle. This is very likely to happen to one RToken or the other whenever veRSR governance changes the fee.

These issues, like the one identified in TRST-L-2, are temporary and limited to single distribution cycles. The first case could be repeated and even automated to continuously evade paying the appropriate DAO fee.

## [L-13] Issuance premium calculation may be inaccurate for view functions

The `issuancePremium()` function in `BasketHandler` assumes that `refresh()` has been called on the collateral token in the current block. If this assumption is not met, it returns `FIX_ONE` instead of calculating the actual premium. While this is generally not an issue because the protocol holds this invariant, it can lead to inaccurate results when called from external view functions that cannot trigger a `refresh()`, such as `RTokenAsset.price()`.

To improve accuracy and consistency, consider modifying `issuancePremium()` to calculate the premium regardless of when `refresh()` was last called. This would ensure more accurate premium values are returned even when accessed through view functions or external calls.

## [L-14] Distribution validation is inconsistent due to inclusion of variable DAO fee

The `Distributor._ensureSufficientTotal()` function is called with the return values of `totals()`, which includes the DAO fee in its calculations. This can lead to a situation where previously valid distributions become invalid if the DAO fee is lowered, as the sum of `rTokenTotal` and `rsrTotal` may fall below `MAX_DISTRIBUTION`.

To ensure consistent behavior regardless of DAO fee changes, `_ensureSufficientTotal()` should only consider the sum of `rTokenDist` and `rsrDist` values from the actual distributions, excluding the DAO fee.

# [Mitigation Review](#mitigation-review)

## Introduction

Following the C4 audit, 4 wardens ([RadiantLabs](https://code4rena.com/@RadiantLabs) ([3docSec](https://code4rena.com/@3docSec) and [EV\_om](https://code4rena.com/@EV_om)), [ether\_sky](https://code4rena.com/@ether_sky) and [Bauchibred](https://code4rena.com/@Bauchibred)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues. Additional details can be found within the [C4 Reserve Core Mitigation Review repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-09-reserve-mitigation).

## Mitigation Review Scope

### Mitigation of High & Medium Severity Issues
