# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Reserve smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between January 6—January 20 2023.

Following the C4 audit contest, 3 wardens (0xA5DF, HollaDieWaldfee, and [AkshaySrivastav](https://twitter.com/akshaysrivastv)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues; the mitigation review report is appended below the audit contest report.

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Adversary can abuse a quirk of compound redemption to manipulate the underlying exchange rate and maliciously disable cToken collaterals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/310)
*Submitted by [0x52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/310)*

Adversary can maliciously disable cToken collateral to cause loss to rToken during restructuring.

### Proof of Concept

    if (referencePrice < prevReferencePrice) {
        markStatus(CollateralStatus.DISABLED);
    }

CTokenNonFiatCollateral and CTokenFiatCollateral both use the default refresh behavior presented in FiatCollateral which has the above lines which automatically disables the collateral if the reference price ever decreases. This makes the assumption that cToken exchange rates never decrease but this is an incorrect assumption and can be exploited by an attacker to maliciously disable a cToken being used as collateral.

[CToken.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L480-L505)

        uint redeemTokens;
        uint redeemAmount;
        /* If redeemTokensIn > 0: */
        if (redeemTokensIn > 0) {
            /*
             * We calculate the exchange rate and the amount of underlying to be redeemed:
             *  redeemTokens = redeemTokensIn
             *  redeemAmount = redeemTokensIn x exchangeRateCurrent
             */
            redeemTokens = redeemTokensIn;
            redeemAmount = mul_ScalarTruncate(exchangeRate, redeemTokensIn);
        } else {
            /*
             * We get the current exchange rate and calculate the amount to be redeemed:
             *  redeemTokens = redeemAmountIn / exchangeRate
             *  redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn
             */

            // @audit redeemTokens rounds in favor of the user

            redeemTokens = div_(redeemAmountIn, exchangeRate);
            redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn;
        }

The exchange rate can be manipulated by a tiny amount during the redeem process. The focus above is the scenario where the user requests a specific amount of underlying. When calculating the number of cTokens to redeem for a specific amount of underlying it rounds IN FAVOR of the user. This allows the user to redeem more underlying than the exchange rate would otherwise imply. Because the user can redeem *slightly* more than intended they can create a scenario in which the exchange rate actually drops after they redeem. This is because compound calculates the exchange rate dynamically using the current supply of cTokens and the assets under management.

[CToken.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L293-L312)

    function exchangeRateStoredInternal() virtual internal view returns (uint) {
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply;
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            /*
             * If there are no tokens minted:
             *  exchangeRate = initialExchangeRate
             */
            return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
        } else {
            /*
             * Otherwise:
             *  exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalSupply
             */
            uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale / _totalSupply;


            return exchangeRate;
        }
    }

The exchangeRate when \_totalSupply != 0 is basically:

    exchangeRate = netAssets * 1e18 / totalSupply

Using this formula for we can now walk through an example of how this can be exploited

Example:

cTokens always start at a whole token ratio of 50:1 so let's assume this ratio to begin with. Let's use values similar to the current supply of cETH which is \~15M cETH and \~300k ETH. We'll start by calculating the current ratio:

    exchangeRate = 300_000 * 1e18 * 1e18 / 15_000_000 * 1e8 = 2e26 

Now to exploit the ratio we request to redeem 99e8 redeemAmount which we can use to calculate the amount of tokens we need to burn:

    redeemAmount = 99e8 * 1e18 / 2e26 = 1.98 -> 1

After truncation the amount burned is only 1. Now we can recalculate our ratio:

    exchangeRate = ((300_000 * 1e18 * 1e18) - 99e8) / ((15_000_000 * 1e8) - 1) = 199999999999999933333333333

The ratio has now been slightly decreased. In CTokenFiatCollateral the exchange rate is truncated to 18 dp so:

    (referencePrice < prevReferencePrice) -> (19999999999999993 <  2e18) == true 

This results in that the collateral is now disabled. This forces the vault to liquidate their holdings to convert to a backup asset. This will almost certainly incur losses to the protocol that were maliciously inflicted.

The path to exploit is relatively straightforward:

`refresh()` cToken collateral to store current rate -> Manipulate compound rate via redemption -> `refresh()` cToken collateral to disable

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Since the issue is with the underlying compound contracts, nothing can make the attack impossible but it can be made sufficiently difficult. The simplest deterrent would be to implement a rate error value (i.e. 100) so that the exchange rate has to drop more than that before the token is disabled. The recommended value for this is a bit more complicated to unpack. The amount that the exchange rate changes heavily depends on the number of cTokens minted. The larger the amount the less it changes. Additionally a malicious user can make consecutive redemptions to lower the rate even further. Using an error rate of 1e12 would make it nearly impossible for this to be exploited while still being very sensitive to real (and concerning) changes in exchange rate.

    -   if (referencePrice < prevReferencePrice) {
    +   if (referencePrice < prevReferencePrice - rateError) {
            markStatus(CollateralStatus.DISABLED);
        }

## [[H-02] Basket range formula is inefficient, leading the protocol to unnecessary haircut](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/235)
*Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/235), also found by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/317)*

The `BackingManager.manageTokens()` function checks if there's any deficit in collateral, in case there is, if there's a surplus from another collateral token it trades it to cover the deficit, otherwise it goes for a 'haircut' and cuts the amount of basket 'needed' (i.e. the number of baskets RToken claims to hold).

In order to determine how much deficit/surplus there is the protocol calculates the 'basket range', where the top range is the optimistic estimation of the number of baskets the token would hold after trading and the bottom range is a pessimistic estimation.

The estimation is done by dividing the total collateral value by the price of 1  basket unit (for optimistic estimation the max value is divided by min price of basket-unit and vice versa).

The problem is that this estimation is inefficient, for cases where just a little bit of collateral is missing the range 'band' (range.top - range.bottom) would be about 4% (when oracle error deviation is ±1%) instead of less than 1%.

This can cause the protocol an unnecessary haircut of a few percent where the deficit can be solved by simple trading.

This would also cause the price of `RTokenAsset` to deviate more than necessary before the haircut.

### Proof of Concept

In the following PoC, the basket changed so that it has 99% of the required collateral for 3 tokens and 95% for the 4th.

The basket range should be 98±0.03% (the basket has 95% collateral + 4% of 3/4 tokens. That 4% is worth 3±0.03% if we account for oracle error of their prices), but in reality the protocol calculates it as \~97.9±2%.

That range causes the protocol to avoid trading and go to an unnecessary haircut to \~95%

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the formula so that we first calculate the 'base' (i.e. the min amount of baskets the RToken can satisfy without trading):

    base = basketsHeldBy(backingManager) // in the PoC's case it'd be 95
    (diffLowValue, diffHighValue) = (0,0) 
    for each collateral token:
        diff = collateralBalance - basketHandler.quantity(base) 
        (diffLowValue, diffHighValue) = diff * (priceLow, priceHigh)
    addBasketsLow = diffLowValue / basketPriceHigh
    addBasketHigh = diffHighValue / basketPriceLow
    range.top = base + addBasketHigh
    range.bottom = base + addBasketLow

# Medium Risk Findings (25)
## [[M-01] Battery discharge mechanism doesn't work correctly for first redemption](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/452)
*Submitted by [AkshaySrivastav](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/452)*

The `RTokenP1` contract implements a throttling mechanism using the `RedemptionBatteryLib` library. The library models a "battery" which "recharges" linearly block by block, over roughly 1 hour.

RToken.sol

```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 amount) external notFrozen {
        // ...

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        // ...
        battery.discharge(supply, amount); // reverts on over-redemption

        // ...
    }
```

RedemptionBatteryLib.sol

```solidity
    function discharge(
        Battery storage battery,
        uint256 supply,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        if (battery.redemptionRateFloor == 0 && battery.scalingRedemptionRate == 0) return;

        // {qRTok}
        uint256 charge = currentCharge(battery, supply);

        // A nice error message so people aren't confused why redemption failed
        require(amount <= charge, "redemption battery insufficient");

        // Update battery
        battery.lastBlock = uint48(block.number);
        battery.lastCharge = charge - amount;
    }

    /// @param supply {qRTok} Total RToken supply before the burn step
    /// @return charge {qRTok} The current total charge as an amount of RToken
    function currentCharge(Battery storage battery, uint256 supply)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 charge)
    {
        // {qRTok/hour} = {qRTok} * D18{1/hour} / D18
        uint256 amtPerHour = (supply * battery.scalingRedemptionRate) / FIX_ONE_256;

        if (battery.redemptionRateFloor > amtPerHour) amtPerHour = battery.redemptionRateFloor;

        // {blocks}
        uint48 blocks = uint48(block.number) - battery.lastBlock; 

        // {qRTok} = {qRTok} + {qRTok/hour} * {blocks} / {blocks/hour}
        charge = battery.lastCharge + (amtPerHour * blocks) / BLOCKS_PER_HOUR;

        uint256 maxCharge = amtPerHour > supply ? supply : amtPerHour;
        if (charge > maxCharge) charge = maxCharge;
    }
```

The linear redemption limit is calculated in the `currentCharge` function. This function calculates the delta blocks by `uint48 blocks = uint48(block.number) - battery.lastBlock;`.

The bug here is that the `lastBlock` value is never initialized by the `RTokenP1` contract so its value defaults to `0`. This results in incorrect delta blocks value as the delta blocks comes out to be an incorrectly large value

            blocks = current block number - 0 = current block number

Due do this issue, the `currentCharge` value comes out to be way larger than the actual intended value for the first RToken redemption. The `maxCharge` cap at the end of `currentCharge` function caps the result to the current total supply of RToken.

The issue results in an instant first RToken redemption for the full `totalSupply` of the RToken. The battery discharging mechanism is completely neglected.

It should be noted that the issue only exists for the first ever redemption as during the first redemption the `lastBlock` value gets updated with current block number.

### Proof of Concept

The following test case was added to `test/RToken.test.ts` file and was ran using command `PROTO_IMPL=1 npx hardhat test ./test/RToken.test.ts`.

```typescript
  describe.only('Battery lastBlock bug', () => {
    it('redemption battery does not work on first redemption', async () => {
      // real chain scenario
      await advanceBlocks(1_000_000)
      await Promise.all(tokens.map((t) => t.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, ethers.constants.MaxUint256)))

      expect(await rToken.totalSupply()).to.eq(0)
      await rToken.connect(owner).setRedemptionRateFloor(fp('1e4'))
      await rToken.connect(owner).setScalingRedemptionRate(fp('0'))

      // first issue
      const issueAmount = fp('10000')
      await rToken.connect(addr1)['issue(uint256)'](issueAmount)
      expect(await rToken.balanceOf(addr1.address)).to.eq(issueAmount)
      expect(await rToken.totalSupply()).to.eq(issueAmount)

      // first redemption
      expect(await rToken.redemptionLimit()).to.eq(await rToken.totalSupply())    // for first redemption the currentCharge value is capped by rToken.totalSupply() 
      await rToken.connect(addr1).redeem(issueAmount)
      expect(await rToken.totalSupply()).to.eq(0)

      // second redemption
      await rToken.connect(addr1)['issue(uint256)'](issueAmount)
      expect(await rToken.balanceOf(addr1.address)).to.eq(issueAmount)
      // from second redemtion onwards the battery discharge mechanism takes place correctly
      await expect(rToken.connect(addr1).redeem(issueAmount)).to.be.revertedWith('redemption battery insufficient')
    })
  })
```

### Tools Used

Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `battery.lastBlock` value must be initialized in the `init` function of `RTokenP1`

```solidity
    function init(
        // ...
    ) external initializer {
        // ...
        battery.lastBlock = uint48(block.number);
    }
```

## [[M-02] Attacker can make stakeRate to be 1 in the StRSR contract and users depositing tokens can lose funds because of the big rounding error](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/439)
*Submitted by [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/439)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L160-L188><br>

Code calculates amount of stake token and rsr token based on `stakeRate` and if `stakeRate` was near `1e18` then division error is small but attacker can cause `stakeRate` to be 1 and that can cause users to loss up to `1e18` token during stake and unstake.

### Proof of Concept

This is `init()` code:

        function init(
            IMain main_,
            string calldata name_,
            string calldata symbol_,
            uint48 unstakingDelay_,
            uint48 rewardPeriod_,
            uint192 rewardRatio_
        ) external initializer {
            require(bytes(name_).length > 0, "name empty");
            require(bytes(symbol_).length > 0, "symbol empty");
            __Component_init(main_);
            __EIP712_init(name_, "1");
            name = name_;
            symbol = symbol_;

            assetRegistry = main_.assetRegistry();
            backingManager = main_.backingManager();
            basketHandler = main_.basketHandler();
            rsr = IERC20(address(main_.rsr()));

            payoutLastPaid = uint48(block.timestamp);
            rsrRewardsAtLastPayout = main_.rsr().balanceOf(address(this));
            setUnstakingDelay(unstakingDelay_);
            setRewardPeriod(rewardPeriod_);
            setRewardRatio(rewardRatio_);

            beginEra();
            beginDraftEra();
        }

As you can see it sets the value of the `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` as contract balance when contract is deployed.
This is `_payoutReward()` code:

        function _payoutRewards() internal {
            if (block.timestamp < payoutLastPaid + rewardPeriod) return;
            uint48 numPeriods = (uint48(block.timestamp) - payoutLastPaid) / rewardPeriod;

            uint192 initRate = exchangeRate();
            uint256 payout;

            // Do an actual payout if and only if stakers exist!
            if (totalStakes > 0) {
                // Paying out the ratio r, N times, equals paying out the ratio (1 - (1-r)^N) 1 time.
                // Apply payout to RSR backing
                // payoutRatio: D18 = FIX_ONE: D18 - FixLib.powu(): D18
                // Both uses of uint192(-) are fine, as it's equivalent to FixLib.sub().
                uint192 payoutRatio = FIX_ONE - FixLib.powu(FIX_ONE - rewardRatio, numPeriods);

                // payout: {qRSR} = D18{1} * {qRSR} / D18
                payout = (payoutRatio * rsrRewardsAtLastPayout) / FIX_ONE;
                stakeRSR += payout;
            }

            payoutLastPaid += numPeriods * rewardPeriod;
            rsrRewardsAtLastPayout = rsrRewards();

            // stakeRate else case: D18{qStRSR/qRSR} = {qStRSR} * D18 / {qRSR}
            // downcast is safe: it's at most 1e38 * 1e18 = 1e56
            // untestable:
            //      the second half of the OR comparison is untestable because of the invariant:
            //      if totalStakes == 0, then stakeRSR == 0
            stakeRate = (stakeRSR == 0 || totalStakes == 0)
                ? FIX_ONE
                : uint192((totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR);

            emit RewardsPaid(payout);
            emit ExchangeRateSet(initRate, exchangeRate());
        }

As you can see it sets the value of the `stakeRate`  to `(totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR`.

So to exploit this attacker needs to perform these steps:

1.  send `200 * 1e18` RSR tokens (18 is the precision) to the StRSR address before its deployment by watching mempool and front running. the deployment address is calculable before deployment.
2.  function `init()` would get executed and would set `200 * 1e18` as `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout`.
3.  then attacker would call `stake()` and stake 1 RSR token (1 wei) in the contract and the value of `stakeRSR` and `totalStakes` would be 1.
4.  then attacker wait for `rewardPeriod` seconds and then call `payoutReward()` and code would pay rewards based on `rewardRatio` and `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` and as `rewardRatio` is higher than 1% (default and normal mode) code would increase `stakeRate` more than `2 * 1e18` amount. and then code would set `stakeRate` as `totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR = 1`.
5.  then calls to `stake()` would cause users to lose up to `1e18` RSR tokens as code calculates stake amount as `newTotalStakes = (stakeRate * newStakeRSR) / FIX_ONE` and rounding error happens up to `FIX_ONE`. because the calculated stake amount is worth less than deposited rsr amount up to `1e18`.
6.  attacker can still users funds by unstaking 1 token and receiving `1e18` RSR tokens. because of the rounding error in `unstake()`

so attacker can manipulate the `stakeRate` in contract deployment time with sandwich attack which can cause other users to lose funds because of the big rounding error.

## [[M-03] Baited by redemption during undercollateralization (no issuance, just transfer)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/416)
*Submitted by [Cyfrin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/416)*

This is similar to the "high" vulnerability I submitted, but also shows a similar exploit can be done if a user isn't a whale, and isn't issuing anything.

A user can send a redeem TX and an evil actor can make it so they get almost nothing back during recollateralization. This requires ordering transactions, or just getting very unlucky with the order of your transaction.

### Proof of Concept

*   UserA is looking to redeem their rToken for tokenA (the max the battery will allow, let's say 100k)

*   A basket refresh is about to be triggered

*   Evil user wants the protocol to steal UserA's funds

*   UserA sends redeem TX to the mempool, but Evil user move transactions around before it hits

*   Evil user calls refreshbasket in same block as original collateral (tokenA) is disabled, kicking in backupconfig (tokenB)

*   Protocol is now undercollateralized but collateral is sound (tokenB is good)

*   Evil sends 1tokenB to backingManager to UserA's redeem has something to redeem

*   UserA's redemption tx lands, and redeems 100k rTokens for a fraction of tokenB!

UserA redeems and has nothing to show for it!

Evil user only had to buy 1 tokenB (or even less) to steal 100k of their rToken.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disallow redemptions/issuance during undercollateralization

## [[M-04] Redemptions during undercollateralization can be hot-swapped to steal all funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/399)
*Submitted by [Cyfrin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/399), also found by [Cyfrin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/411)*

During recollateralization/a switch basket/when the protocol collateral isn't sound, a user can have almost their entire redemption transaction hot swapped for nothing.

For example, trying to redeem 1M collateral for 1M rTokens could have the user end up with 0 collateral and 0 rTokens, just by calling the `redeem` function at the wrong time.

Example:

*   User A issues 1M rToken for 1M tokenA

*   Evil user sees tokenA is about to become disabled, and that User A sent a normally innocuous redeem tx for too much underlying collateral in the mempool

*   Evil user orders transactions so they and RSR/Rtoken holders can steal user A's funds

*   They first buy a ton of tokenA and send it to the backing Manager

*   They call `manageTokens` which flash issues a ton of new Rtoken due to the inflated tokenA balance, increasing the totalSupply

*   The increase in total supply allows the normal redemption cap to be drastically lifted

*   They then let the disabling of tokenA process, and calls refreshBasket where a backup token (tokenB) kicks in

*   We are now undercollateralized, and evil user sends tokenB dust to the backingmanager

*   FINALLY: the original redemption TX is ordered, and due to the inflated RToken supply, the battery discharge amount is also inflated, allowing the redemption to go through. Due to the new collateral in place, they redeem ALL their Rtoken (1M) for dust of tokenB!! The protocol has essentially honeypotted them!!

### Proof of Concept

We provide the proof of code in `proof of code` section.

1.  MEV

This relies on a validator being malicious with for-profit motives. It would be pretty easy for them to setup a bot looking for this exact scenario though and just staying dormant till the time is right. If they get to order the transactions, they can make a fat profit from the victim.

2.  Backing manager can flash issue RToken

If the backingManger has too many excess assets, it will flash issue as [many RTokens as](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/fdd9f81fe58953d758dbea62beed169a74523de1/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L201) possible to even the collateral to RTokens.

    function handoutExcessAssets(IERC20[] calldata erc20s) private {
    .
    .
    if (held.gt(needed)) {
    .
    .
    rToken.mint(address(this), uint256(rTok));

3.  Increasing the supply increases the redemption and issuance block cap

The RedemptionBattery's currentCharge function is [dependent on the total supply of RTokens](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/fdd9f81fe58953d758dbea62beed169a74523de1/contracts/libraries/RedemptionBattery.sol#L59). So if the total supply is raised, you can redeem way more than you should be able to.

    uint256 amtPerHour = (supply * battery.scalingRedemptionRate) / FIX_ONE_256;

(This also is true for issuance.)

4.  Anyone can call [refreshBasket when a collateral](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/fdd9f81fe58953d758dbea62beed169a74523de1/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L179) is disabled

```

    function refreshBasket() external {
            assetRegistry.refresh();

            require(
                main.hasRole(OWNER, _msgSender()) ||
                    (status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED && !main.pausedOrFrozen()),
                "basket unrefreshable"
            );
            _switchBasket();
        }
```

So if I see a tx where a collateral is about to be disabled, I can chain it with the refreshbasket TX myself.

5.  Redemptions can occur when protocol is undercollateralized

The `redeem` function has this check:

    require(basketHandler.status() != CollateralStatus.DISABLED, "collateral default");

Which checks if the collateral is good, but NOT if the protocol is fullyCollateralized. Since we chain the disabled asset with the refreshBasket TX, the backup collateral kicks in, and the collateral status becomes `SOUND`. However, normally, we'd have 0 of the new collateral and any redemptions would fail, since there isn't anything to give back.

6.  Sending dust to backing manager

So, if you send a tiny tiny bit of the new collateral to the protocol, the protocol will process the redemption and give them their `prorata` share of the collateral, which right now is almost 0, but still burn all the rToken being redeemed.

[RToken.sol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/fdd9f81fe58953d758dbea62beed169a74523de1/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L475)

    // amount is never changed, they burn all the rToken
    // in our example above, all 1M Rtoken are burned!
    _burn(redeemer, amount);

And we calculate how much they get back like so. We see how much `$` we currently have in the basket, and hand back those amounts accordingly. Since we have almost no money, we are going to give them almost nothing for their rTokens.

    (address[] memory erc20s, uint256[] memory amounts) = basketHandler.quote(baskets, FLOOR);
    uint256 erc20length = erc20s.length;
    // Bound each withdrawal by the prorata share, in case we're currently under-collateralized
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < erc20length; ++i) {
                // {qTok}
                uint256 bal = IERC20Upgradeable(erc20s[i]).balanceOf(address(backingManager));

                // gas-optimization: only do the full mulDiv256 if prorate is 0
                uint256 prorata = (prorate > 0)
                    ? (prorate * bal) / FIX_ONE // {qTok} = D18{1} * {qTok} / D18
                    : mulDiv256(bal, amount, supply); // {qTok} = {qTok} * {qRTok} / {qRTok}

                if (prorata < amounts[i]) amounts[i] = prorata;
            }

And just like that, a seemingly innocuous redemption transaction was a trap the whole time. The next step would be to go through the rest of the process to see how much our evil user profited (from running the auctions), as they need to be a whale to inflate the RToken supply. However, we've seen attacks like this, and one could consider it a [highly profitable trading strategy](https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160?s=20\&t=8WpEg76bW_Kk8YaJ5orP5Q). If they buy up majority shares in the RToken, or, they coordinate with most of the StRSR token holders they could advertise and honey pot people to do redemptions whenever a switchBasket is coming. Spread FUD like "you need to redeem otherwise you'll lose money!" and it's the redeeming that actually steals their money.

An MEV searcher can order a `refreshBasket()` call earlier in the block, causing the redemption to be partial. This acts as a net transfer between the RToken redeemer and RSR stakers, who will eventually collect the money.

Function `melt()` melt a quantity of RToken from the caller's account, increasing the basket rate. basket rate should be between `1e9` and `1e27` and function `requireValidBUExchangeRate()` checks that if it's not in interval the the code would revert. the call to `requireValidBUExchangeRate()` happens in the function `mint()`, `melt()` and `setBasketsNeeded()` which are used in `issue()` and `handoutExcessAssets()` and `compromiseBasketsNeeded()` which are used in multiple functionality of the systems. early malicious user can call `issue(1e18)` and `melt(1e18 - 1)` and then set the ratio between baskets needed and total supply to `1e27` and then any new action that increase the ratio would fail. because during the `issue()` code calls `melt()` so the issue() would fail for sure and other functionalities can increase the ratio because of the ratio too because of the rounding error which result in revert. so by exploiting this attacker can make RToken to be in broken state and most of the functionalities of the system would stop working.

### Proof of Concept

This is `melt()` code:

        function melt(uint256 amtRToken) external notPausedOrFrozen {
            _burn(_msgSender(), amtRToken);
            emit Melted(amtRToken);
            requireValidBUExchangeRate();
        }

As you can see it allows anyone to burn their RToken balance. This is `requireValidBUExchangeRate()` code:

        function requireValidBUExchangeRate() private view {
            uint256 supply = totalSupply();
            if (supply == 0) return;

            // Note: These are D18s, even though they are uint256s. This is because
            // we cannot assume we stay inside our valid range here, as that is what
            // we are checking in the first place
            uint256 low = (FIX_ONE_256 * basketsNeeded) / supply; // D18{BU/rTok}
            uint256 high = (FIX_ONE_256 * basketsNeeded + (supply - 1)) / supply; // D18{BU/rTok}

            // 1e9 = FIX_ONE / 1e9; 1e27 = FIX_ONE * 1e9
            require(uint192(low) >= 1e9 && uint192(high) <= 1e27, "BU rate out of range");
        }

As you can see it checks and makes sure that  the BU to RToken exchange rate to be in \[1e-9, 1e9]. so Attacker can perform this steps:

1.  add `1e18` RToken as first issuer by calling `issue()`
2.  call `melt()` and burn `1e18 - 1` of his RTokens.
3.  not `basketsNeeded` would be `1e18` and `totalSupply()` of RTokens would be `1` and the BU to RToken exchange rate would be its maximum value `1e27` and `requireValidBUExchangeRate()` won't allow increasing the ratio.
4.  now calls to `melt()` would revert and because `issue()` calls to `furnace.melt()` which calls `RToken.melt()` so all calls to `issue()` would revert. other functionality which result in calling `mint()`, `melt()` and `setBasketsNeeded()` if they increase the ratio would fail too. as there is rounding error when converting RToken amount to basket amount so burning and minting new RTokens and increase the ratio too because of those rounding errors and those logics would revert. (`handoutExcessAssets()` would revert because it mint revenue RToken and update `basketsNeeded` and it calculates new basket amount based on RToken amounts and rounds down so it would increase the BU to RToken ratio which cause code to revert in `mint()`) (`redeem()` would increase the ratio simillar to `handoutExcessAssets()` because of rounding down)
5.  the attacker doesn't need to be first issuer just he needs to be one of the early issuers and by performing the attack and also if the ratio gets to higher value of the maximum allowed the protocol won't work properly as it documented the supported rage for variables to work properly.

So attacker can make protocol logics to be broken and then RToken won't be useless and attacker can perform this attack to any newly deployed RToken.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Don't allow everyone to melt their tokens or don't allow melting if totalSupply() become very small.

## [[M-06] Too few rewards paid over periods in Furnace and StRSR](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/377)
*Submitted by [Franfran](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/377)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Furnace.sol#L77-L79><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L509-L512><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/946d9b101dd77275c6cbfe0bfe9457927bd221a9/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L490-L493>

For two instances in the codebase ([`Furnace`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Furnace.sol#L77-L79) and [`StRSR`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L509-L512)), the composed rewards calculation seems to be wrong.

How the rewards are working in these two snippets is that we are first measuring how much `period` or `rewardPeriod` occured since the last payout and calculating in only **one** step the rewards that should be distributed over these periods. In other words, it is composing the ratio over periods.

### Proof of Concept

Taken from the [comments](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/946d9b101dd77275c6cbfe0bfe9457927bd221a9/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L490-L493), we can write the formula of the next rewards payout as:

    with n = (i+1) > 0, n is the number of periods
    rewards{0} = rsrRewards()
    payout{i+1} = rewards{i} * payoutRatio
    rewards{i+1} = rewards{i} - payout{i+1}
    rewards{i+1} = rewards{i} * (1 - payoutRatio)

Generalization:
$$u\_{i+1} = u\_{i} * (1 - r)$$

It's a geometric mean whose growth rate is `(1 - r)`.

Calculation of the sum:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274081/213756676-cbbcf22b-3237-433d-a6e3-9577b6d75474.png)

You can play with the graph [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1fnpsnf8nt).

For a practical example, let's say that our `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` is 5, with a `rewardRatio` of 0.9.

If we had to calculate our compounded rewards, from the formula given by the comments above, we could calculate manually for the first elements. Let's take the sum for n = 3:

$$S = u\_{2} + u\_{1} + u\_{0}$$
$$u\_{2} = u\_{1} * (1-0.9)$$
$$u\_{1} = u\_{0} * (1-0.9)$$
$$u\_{0} = rsrRewardsAtLastPayout$$

So,

$$S = u\_{0} * (1-0.9) * (1-0.9) + u\_{0} * (1-0.9) + u\_{0}$$

For the values given above, that's

$$S = 5 * 0.1² + 5 * 0.1 + 5$$
$$S = 5.55$$

If we do the same calculation with the sum formula

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274081/213756989-03bb092b-a0a3-447a-a0e8-83035559be7b.png)
$$S' = 4.995$$

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Rather than dividing by 1 (1e18 from the Fixed library), divide it by the `ratio`.

```solidity
// Furnace.sol
// Paying out the ratio r, N times, equals paying out the ratio (1 - (1-r)^N) 1 time.
uint192 payoutRatio = FIX_ONE.minus(FIX_ONE.minus(ratio).powu(numPeriods));

uint256 amount = payoutRatio * lastPayoutBal / ratio;
```

```solidity
// StRSR.sol
uint192 payoutRatio = FIX_ONE - FixLib.powu(FIX_ONE - rewardRatio, numPeriods);

// payout: {qRSR} = D18{1} * {qRSR} / r
uint256 payout = (payoutRatio * rsrRewardsAtLastPayout) / rewardRatio;
```

If `u_0` is the value of `rsrRewards()` at time 0, and `u_1` is the value of `rsrRewards()` at time 1, why is the sum of `u_i` for all i interesting?

## [[M-07] Attacker can steal RToken holders' funds by performing reentrancy attack during `redeem()` function token transfers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/347)

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L105-L150>

Function `redeem()` redeems RToken for basket collateral and it updated `basketsNeeded` and transfers users basket ERC20 from BackingManager to user address. it loops through tokens and transfer them to caller and if one of tokens were ERC777 or any other 3rd party protocol token with hook, attacker can perform reentrancy attack during token transfers. Attacker can cause multiple impacts by choosing the reentrancy function:

1.  attacker can call `redeem()` again and bypass "bounding each withdrawal by the prorata share when protocol is under-collateralized" because tokens balance of BackingManager is not updated yet.
2.  attacker can call `BackingManager.manageTokens()` and because `basketsNeeded` gets decreased and basket tokens balances of BasketManager are not updated, code would detect those tokens as excess funds and would distribute them between RSR stakers and RToken holders and some of RToken deposits would get transferred to RSR holders as rewards.

### Proof of Concept

This is `redeem()` code:

        function redeem(uint256 amount) external notFrozen {
    ...............
    ...............
            (address[] memory erc20s, uint256[] memory amounts) = basketHandler.quote(baskets, FLOOR);

            uint256 erc20length = erc20s.length;

            uint192 prorate = uint192((FIX_ONE_256 * amount) / supply);

            // Bound each withdrawal by the prorata share, in case we're currently under-collateralized
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < erc20length; ++i) {
                uint256 bal = IERC20Upgradeable(erc20s[i]).balanceOf(address(backingManager));

                uint256 prorata = (prorate > 0)
                    ? (prorate * bal) / FIX_ONE // {qTok} = D18{1} * {qTok} / D18
                    : mulDiv256(bal, amount, supply); // {qTok} = {qTok} * {qRTok} / {qRTok}

                if (prorata < amounts[i]) amounts[i] = prorata;
            }

            basketsNeeded = basketsNeeded_ - baskets;
            emit BasketsNeededChanged(basketsNeeded_, basketsNeeded);

            // == Interactions ==
            _burn(redeemer, amount);

            bool allZero = true;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < erc20length; ++i) {
                if (amounts[i] == 0) continue;
                if (allZero) allZero = false;

                IERC20Upgradeable(erc20s[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                    address(backingManager),
                    redeemer,
                    amounts[i]
                );
            }

            if (allZero) revert("Empty redemption");
        }

As you can see code calculates withdrawal amount of each basket erc20 tokens by calling `basketHandler.quote()` and then bounds each withdrawal by the prorata share of token balance, in case protocol is under-collateralized. and then code updates `basketsNeeded` and in the end transfers the tokens.  if one of those tokens were ERC777 then that token would call receiver hook function in token transfer. there may be other 3rd party protocol tokens that calls registered hook functions during the token transfer. as reserve protocol is permission less and tries to work with all tokens so the external call in the token transfer can call hook functions. attacker can use this hook and perform reentrancy attack.

This is `fullyCollateralized()` code in BasketHandler:

        function fullyCollateralized() external view returns (bool) {
            return basketsHeldBy(address(backingManager)) >= rToken.basketsNeeded();
        }

As you can see it calculates baskets that can be held by backingManager tokens balance and needed baskets by RToken contract and by comparing them determines that if RToken is fully collateralized or not. If RToken is fully collateralized then `BackingManager.manageTokens()` would call `handoutExcessAssets()` and would distribute extra funds between RToken holders and RSR stakers.

The root cause of the issue is that during tokens transfers in `redeem()` not all the basket tokens balance of the BackingManager updates once and if one has hook function which calls attacker contract then attacker can use this updated token balance of the contract and perform his reentrancy attack. attacker can call different functions for reentrancy. these are two scenarios:

**Scenario #1: attacker call `redeem()` again and bypass prorata share bound check when protocol is under-collaterialized:**

1.  tokens \[`SOME_ERC777`, `USDT`] with quantity \[1, 1] are in the basket right now and basket nonce is BasketNonce1.
2.  BackingManager has 200K `SOME_ERC777` balance and 100K `USDT` balance. `basketsNeeded` in RToken is 150K and RToken supply is 150K and attacker address Attacker1 has 30k RToken. battery charge allows for attacker to withdraw 30K tokens in one block.
3.  attacker would register a hook for his address in `SOME_ERC777` token to get called during transfers.
4.  attacker would call `redeem()` to redeem 15K RToken and code would updated `basketsNeeded` to 135K and code would bounds withdrawal by prorata shares of balance of the BackingManager because protocol is under-collateralized and code would calculated withdrawal amouns as 15K `SOME_ERC777` tokens and 10K `USDT` tokens (instead of 15K `USDT` tokens) for withdraws.
5.  then contract would transfer 15K `SOME_ERC777` tokens first to attacker address and attacker contract would get called during the hook function and now `basketsNeeded` is 135K and total RTokens is 135K and BackingManager balance is 185K `SOME_ERC777` and 100K `USDT` (`USDT` is not yet transferred). then attacker contract can call `redeem()` again for the remaining 15K RTokens.
6.  because protocol is under-collateralized code would calculated withdrawal amouns as 15K `SOME_ERC777` and 11.1K `USDT` (USDT_balance &ast; rtokenAmount / totalSupply = 100K &ast; 15K / 135K) and it would burn 15K RToken form caller and the new value of totalSupply of RTokens would be 120K and `basketsNeeded` would be 120K too. then code would transfers 15K `SOME_ERC777` and 11.1K `USDT` for attacker address.
7.  attacker's hook function would return and `redeem()` would transfer 10K `USDT` to attacker in the rest of the execution. attacker would receive 30K `SOME_ERC777` and 21.1K `USDT` tokens for 15K redeemed RToken but attacker should have get (`100 * 30K / 150K = 20K`) 20K `USDT` tokens because of the bound each withdrawal by the prorata share, in case we're currently under-collateralized.
8.  so attacker would be able to bypass the bounding check and withdraw more funds and stole other users funds. the attack is more effective if withdrawal battery charge is higher but in general case attacker can perform two withdraw each with about `charge/2` amount of RToken in each block and stole other users funds when protocol is under collaterlized.

**Scenario #2: attacker can call `BackingManager.manageTokens()` for reentrancy call:**

1.  tokens \[`SOME_ERC777`, `USDT`] with quantity \[1, 1] are in the basket right now and basket nonce is BasketNonce1.
2.  BackingManager has 200K `SOME_ERC777` balance and 150K `USDT` balance. `basketsNeeded` in RToken is 150K and RToken supply is 150K and attacker address Attacker1 has 30k RToken. battery charge allows for attacker to withdraw 30K tokens in one block.
3.  attacker would register a hook for his address in `SOME_ERC777` token to get called during transfers.
4.  attacker would call `redeem()` to redeem 30K RToken and code would updated `basketsNeeded` to 120K and burn 30K RToken and code would calculated withdrawal amounts as 30K `SOME_ERC777` tokens and 30K `USDT` tokens for withdraws.
5.  then contract would transfer 30K `SOME_ERC777` tokens first to attacker address and attacker contract would get called during the hook function and now `basketsNeeded` is 120K and total RTokens is 120K and BackingManager balance is 170K `SOME_ERC777` and 150K `USDT` (`USDT` is not yet transferred). then attacker contract can call `BackingManager.manageTokens()`.
6.  function `manageTokens()` would calculated baskets can held by BackingManager and it would be higher than 150K and `basketsNeeded` would be 130K and code would consider 60K `SOME_ERC777` and 30K `USDT` tokens as revenue and try to distribute it between RSR stakers and RToken holders. code would mint 30K RTokens and would distribute it.
7.  then attacker hook function would return and `redeem()` would transfer 30K `USDT` to attacker address in rest of the execution.
8.  so attacker would able to make code to calculate RToken holders backed tokens as revenue and distribute it between RSR stakers and RSR stakers would receive RTokens backed tokens as rewards. the attack is more effective is battery charge is high but in general case attacker can call redeem for battery charge amount and cause those funds to be counted and get distributed to the RSR stakers (according to the rewards distribution rate)

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Prevent reading reentrancy attack by central reentrancy guard or by one main proxy interface contract that has reentrancy guard.

Or create contract state (similar to basket nonce) which changes after each interaction and check for contracts states change during the call. (start and end of the call)

## [[M-08] `Asset.lotPrice()` doesn't use the most recent price in case of oracle timeout](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/326)
*Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/326)*

`Asset.lotPrice()` has a fallback mechanism in case that `tryPrice()` fails - it uses the last saved price and multiplies its value by `lotMultiplier` (a variable that decreases as the time since the last saved price increase) and returns the results.

However, the `tryPrice()` might fail due to oracle timeout, in that case the last saved price might be older than the oracle's price.

This can cause the backing manager to misestimate the value of the asset, trade it at a lower price, or do an unnecessary haircut.

### Proof of Concept

In the PoC below:

*   Oracle price is set at day 0
*   The asset is refreshed (e.g. somebody issued/vested/redeemed)
*   After 5 days the oracle gets an update
*   25 hours later the `lotPrice()` is calculated based on the oracle price from day 0 even though a price from day 5 is available from the oracle
*   Oracle gets another update
*   25 hours later the `lotPrice()` goes down to zero since it considers the price from day 0 (which is more than a week ago) to be the last saved price, even though a price from a day ago is available from the oracle

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow specifying a timeout to `tryPrice()`, in case that `tryPrice()` fails due to oracle timeout then call it again with `priceTimeout` as the timeout.

If the call succeeds the second time then use it as the most recent price for fallback calculations.

## [[M-09] Withdrawals will stuck](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/325)
*Submitted by [csanuragjain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/325)*

If a new era gets started for stakeRSR and draftRSR still point to old era then user will be at risk of losing their future holdings.

### Proof of Concept

1.  seizeRSR is called with amount 150 where stakeRSR was 50 and draftRSR was 80. The era was 1 currently for both stake and draft

```

    function seizeRSR(uint256 rsrAmount) external notPausedOrFrozen {
    ...
    stakeRSR -= stakeRSRToTake;
    ..
    if (stakeRSR == 0 || stakeRate > MAX_STAKE_RATE) {
                seizedRSR += stakeRSR;
                beginEra();
            }
    ...
    draftRSR -= draftRSRToTake;
    if (draftRSR > 0) {
                // Downcast is safe: totalDrafts is 1e38 at most so expression maximum value is 1e56
                draftRate = uint192((FIX_ONE_256 * totalDrafts + (draftRSR - 1)) / draftRSR);
            }

    ...
```

2.  stakeRSR portion comes to be 50 which means remaining stakeRSR will be 0 (50-50). This means a new staking era will get started

```

    if (stakeRSR == 0 || stakeRate > MAX_STAKE_RATE) {
                seizedRSR += stakeRSR;
                beginEra();
            }
```

3.  This causes staking era to become 2

```

    function beginEra() internal virtual {
            stakeRSR = 0;
            totalStakes = 0;
            stakeRate = FIX_ONE;
            era++;

            emit AllBalancesReset(era);
        }
```

4.  Now draftRSR is still > 0 so only draftRate gets updated. The draft Era still remains 1

5.  User stakes and unstakes in this new era. Staking is done in era 2

6.  Unstaking calls the pushDraft which creates User draft on draftEra which is still 1

```

    function pushDraft(address account, uint256 rsrAmount)
            internal
            returns (uint256 index, uint64 availableAt)
        {
    ...
    CumulativeDraft[] storage queue = draftQueues[draftEra][account];
           ...

            queue.push(CumulativeDraft(uint176(oldDrafts + draftAmount), availableAt));
    ...
    }
```

7.  Lets say due to unfortunate condition again seizeRSR need to be called. This time `draftRate > MAX_DRAFT_RATE` which means draft era increases and becomes 2

```

    if (draftRSR == 0 || draftRate > MAX_DRAFT_RATE) {
                seizedRSR += draftRSR;
                beginDraftEra();
            }
```

8.  This becomes a problem since all unstaking done till now in era 2 were pointing in draft era 1. Once draft era gets updated to 2, all those unstaking are lost.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Era should be same for staking and draft. So if User is unstaking at era 1 then withdrawal draft should always be era 1 and not some previous era.

> That said, I don't think it's a problem to have different eras for stakeRSR and draftRSR. It's subtle, but it could be that due to rounding one of these overflows `MAX_STAKE_RATE`/`MAX_DRAFT_RATE`, but not the other. This is fine. This means enough devaluation has happened to one of the polities (current stakers; current withdrawers) that they have been wiped out. It's not a contradiction for the other polity to still be entitled to a small amount of RSR.
> 
> It also might be the warden is misunderstanding the intended design here: if you initiate StRSR unstaking, then a sufficient RSR seizure event _should_ result in the inability to withdraw anything after.

## [[M-10] Unsafe downcasting in `issue(...)` can be exploited to cause permanent DoS](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/320)
*Submitted by [Soosh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/320)*

**Important note!**

I first found this bug in `issue(...)`, but unsafe downcasting appears in many other areas of the codebase, and seem to also be exploitable but no PoC is provided due to time constraints. Either way, using some form of safe casting library to **replace all occurences** of unsafe downcasting will prevent all the issues. I also do not list the individual instances of unsafe downcasting as all occurences should be replaced with safe cast.

### Details

The `amtRToken` is a user supplied parameter in the `issue(uint256 amtRToken)` function

```sol
uint192 amtBaskets = uint192(
	totalSupply() > 0 ? mulDiv256(basketsNeeded, amtRToken, totalSupply()) : amtRToken
);
```

The calculated amount is unsafely downcasted into `uint192`.

This means that if the resulting calculation is a multiple of $2^{192}$, `amtBaskets = 0`

The code proceeds to the following line, where `erc20s` and `deposits` arrays will be empty since we are asking for a quote for 0. (see `quote(...)` in `BasketHandler.sol` where amounts are multiplied by zero)

```sol
(address[] memory erc20s, uint256[] memory deposits) = basketHandler.quote(
            amtBaskets,
            CEIL
        );
```

This means an attacker can call `issue(...)` with a very high `amtRToken` amount that is a multiple of $2^{192}$, without depositing any amount of collateral.

The DoS issues arises because `whenFinished(uint256 amtRToken)` is dependent on `amtRToken`. With such a high value, `allVestAt` will be set so far in the future that it causes a permanent DoS. i.e. Issuances will never vest.

```sol
uint192 vestingEnd = whenFinished(amtRToken); // D18{block number}
```

### Proof of Concept

This PoC demonstrates that an attacker can call `issue(...)` without collateral tokens to modify `allVestAt` variable to an extreme value, such that all further issuances cannot be vested for all users.

Do note that the PoC is done with `totalSupply() == 0` case, so we supply `amtRToken` as a multiple of $2^{192}$. Even if there is an existing `totalSupply()`, we just need to calculate a value for `amtRToken >= 2^192` such that $\frac{\text{basketsNeeded} \times \text{amtRToken}}{totalSupply()} = 0$. This attack does not require `totalSupply()` be zero.

```sol
uint192 amtBaskets = uint192(
	totalSupply() > 0 ? mulDiv256(basketsNeeded, amtRToken, totalSupply()) : amtRToken
);
```

The `amount`, `baskets` and `quantities` values are also messed up, but it would not matter anyways...

Under 'Issuance and Slow Minting' tests in `RToken.test.ts`:

```sol
it('Audit: DoS by downcasting', async function () {
      const issueAmount: BigNumber = BigNumber.from(2n ** 192n)

      // Set basket
      await basketHandler.connect(owner).setPrimeBasket([token0.address], [fp('1')])
      await basketHandler.connect(owner).refreshBasket()

      // Attacker issues 2 ** 192, or a multiple of 2 ** 192 RTokens
      // This will cause allVestAt to be veryyyyy high, permanent DoS
      const tx = await rToken.connect(addr1)['issue(uint256)'](issueAmount)
      const receipt = await tx.wait()
      console.log(receipt.events[0].args)
  
      await token0.connect(addr2).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      const tx2 = await rToken.connect(addr2)['issue(uint256)'](initialBal)
      const receipt2 = await tx2.wait()
      console.log(receipt2.events[0].args)

      // one eternity later...
      await advanceTime('123456789123456789')
      // and still not ready
      await expect(rToken.connect(addr2).vest(addr2.address, 1))
        .to.be.revertedWith("issuance not ready")

    })
```

Run with:

```bash
yarn test:p1 --grep "Audit: DoS"
```

### Impact

Permanent DoS would be High risk considering RToken is an asset-backed **currency**.<br>
*A currency that is unable to issue new currency does not work as a currency*

Also, I believe existing collateral cannot be redeemed due to the extreme values also used in `redeem(...)` function. No PoC written due to time constriant for this case... but above should be enough impact.

Many other downcasting issues for this project. But using a safe casting library would prevent all the issues... not going to write multiple reports for same underlying issue.

### Recommendations

Use some safe casting library. OpenZeppelin's library does not have safe casting for `uint192` type. May have to find another or write your own.

> 5. RToken is a stable currency which means that it would be used in DeFi protocols. In the case of Lending/Borrowing, it would take even longer for RToken to be redeemed. There may also be loss of funds as a long wait time to redeem RTokens means that the RToken will trade at a discount in secondary markets - this can cause RToken-collateralized loans to be underwater.

In the event of the attack, RToken issuance would be bricked but redemption would remain enabled, and since no RToken is minted until vesting the redemptions would still function.

## [[M-11] Should Accrue Before Change, Loss of Rewards in case of change of settings](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/287)
*Submitted by [GalloDaSballo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/287), also found by [chaduke](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/380), [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/333), and [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/330)*

In `StRSR.sol`, `_payoutRewards` is used to accrue the value of rewards based on the time that has passed since `payoutLastPaid`

Because of it's dependence on `totalStakes`, `stakeRate` and time, the function is rightfully called on every `stake` and `unstake`.

There is a specific instance, in which `_payoutRewards` should also be called, which could create either an unfair reward stream or a governance attack and that's when `setRewardPeriod` and `setRewardRatio` are called.

If you imagine the ratio at which rewards are paid out as a line, then you can see that by changing `rewardRatio` and `period` you're changing it's slope.

You should then agree, that while governance can *rightfully* change those settings, it should `_payoutRewards` first, to ensure that the slope of rewards changes only for rewards to be distributed after the setting has changed.

### Mitigation

Functions that change the slope or period size should accrue rewards up to that point.

This is to avoid:

*   Incorrect reward distribution
*   Change (positive or negative) of rewards from the past

Without accrual, the change will apply retroactively from `payoutLastPaid`

Which could:

*   Change the period length prematurely
*   Start a new period inadvertently
*   Cause a gain or loss of yield to stakers

Instead of starting a new period

### Suggested Refactoring

```solidity
function setRewardPeriod(uint48 val) public governance {
    require(val > 0 && val <= MAX_REWARD_PERIOD, "invalid rewardPeriod");
    _payoutRewards(); // @audit Payout rewards for fairness
    emit RewardPeriodSet(rewardPeriod, val);
    rewardPeriod = val;
    require(rewardPeriod * 2 <= unstakingDelay, "unstakingDelay/rewardPeriod incompatible");
}

function setRewardRatio(uint192 val) public governance {
    require(val <= MAX_REWARD_RATIO, "invalid rewardRatio");
    _payoutRewards(); // @audit Payout rewards for fairness
    emit RewardRatioSet(rewardRatio, val);
    rewardRatio = val;
}

## [[M-12] BackingManager: rsr is distributed across all rsr revenue destinations which is a loss for rsr stakers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/276)
*Submitted by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/276)*

The `BackingManager.handoutExcessAssets` function sends all `rsr` that the `BackingManager` holds to the `rsrTrader` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L173-L179>).

The purpose of this is that `rsr` which can be held by the `BackingManager` due to seizure from the `StRSR` contract is sent back entirely to the `StRSR` contract and not - as would happen later in the function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L221-L242>) - shared across `rsrTrader` and `rTokenTrader`.

The `rsrTrader` then sends the `rsr` to the `Distributor` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/RevenueTrader.sol#L59-L65>).

So far so good. However the `Distributor` does not necessarily send all of the `rsr` to the `StRSR` contract. Instead it distributes the `rsr` according to its distribution table. I.e. there can be multiple destinations each receiving a share of the `rsr` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L108-L136>).

In economic terms, `rsr` that is thereby not sent to `StRSR` but to other destinations, is a transfer of funds from stakers to these destinations, i.e. a loss to stakers.

Stakers should only pay for recollateralization of the `RToken`, not however send revenue to `rsr` revenue destinations.

### Proof of Concept

Assume the following situation:

*   A seizure of `rsr` from the `StRSR` contract occurred because the `RToken` was under-collateralized.

*   A trade occurred which restored collateralization. However not all `rsr` was sold by the trade and was returned to the `BackingManager`.

Now `BackingManager.manageTokens` is called which due to the full collateralization calls `BackingManager.handoutExcessAssets` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L118>).

This sends `rsr` to the `rsrTrader` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L173-L179>).

Then the `rsr` is sent to the `Distributor` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/RevenueTrader.sol#L59-L65>).

There it is distributed across all `rsr` destinations (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L108-L136>).

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`rsr` should be sent from the `BackingManager` directly to `StRSR` without the need to go through `rsrTrader` and `Distributor`. Thereby it won't be sent to other `rsr` revenue destinations.

Fix:

    diff --git a/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol b/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol
    index 431e0796..eb506004 100644
    --- a/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol
    +++ b/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol
    @@ -173,7 +173,7 @@ contract BackingManagerP1 is TradingP1, IBackingManager {
             if (rsr.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
                 // For CEI, this is an interaction "within our system" even though RSR is already live
                 IERC20Upgradeable(address(rsr)).safeTransfer(
    -                address(rsrTrader),
    +                address(stRSR),
                     rsr.balanceOf(address(this))
                 );
             }

There is a caveat to this however:

It is possible for `rsr` to be a reward token for a collateral of the `RToken`.

Neither the current implementation nor the proposed fix addresses this and instead sends the rewards to `StRSR`.

In principal, `rsr` that was rewarded should have a share that goes to the `rTokenTrader` as well as include all `rsr` revenue destinations.

However there is no easy way to differentiate where the `rsr` came from.

Therefore I think it is reasonable to send all `rsr` to `StRSR` and make it clear to developers and users that `rsr` rewards cannot be paid out to `rToken` holders.

## [[M-13] Attacker can prevent vesting for a very long time](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/267)
*Submitted by [immeas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/267), also found by [wait](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/367), [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/364), [JTJabba](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/135), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/116), [hihen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/73), and [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/24)*

When a user wants to issue RTokens there is a limit of how many can be issued in the same block. This is determined in the `whenFinished` function.

It looks at how many tokens the user wants to issue and then using the `issuanceRate` it calculates which block the issuance will end up in, `allVestAt`.

```javascript
File: RToken.sol

358:        uint192 before = allVestAt; // D18{block number}
359:        // uint192 downcast is safe: block numbers are smaller than 1e38
360:        uint192 nowStart = uint192(FIX_ONE * (block.number - 1)); // D18{block} = D18{1} * {block}
361:        if (nowStart > before) before = nowStart;

...

368:        finished = before + uint192((FIX_ONE_256 * amtRToken + (lastIssRate - 1)) / lastIssRate);
369:        allVestAt = finished;
```

If this is the current block and the user has no other queued issuances the issuance can be immediate otherwise it is queued to be issued after the `allVestAt` block.

```javascript
File: RToken.sol

243:        uint192 vestingEnd = whenFinished(amtRToken); // D18{block number}

...

251:        if (
252:            // D18{blocks} <= D18{1} * {blocks}
253:            vestingEnd <= FIX_ONE_256 * block.number &&
254:            queue.left == queue.right &&
255:            status == CollateralStatus.SOUND
256:        ) {
                // do immediate issuance
            }

287:        IssueItem storage curr = (queue.right < queue.items.length)
288:            ? queue.items[queue.right]
289:            : queue.items.push();
290:        curr.when = vestingEnd; // queued at vestingEnd (allVestAt)
```

Then in `vestUpTo` it is checked that this is vested at a later block:

```javascript
File: RToken.sol

746:        IssueItem storage rightItem = queue.items[endId - 1];
747:        require(rightItem.when <= FIX_ONE_256 * block.number, "issuance not ready");
```

If a user decides that they do not want to do this vesting they can cancel pending items using `cancel`, which will return the deposited tokens to them.

However this cancel does not reduce the `allVestAt` state so later issuances will still be compared to this state.

Hence a malicious user can issue a lot of RTokens (possibly using a flash loan) to increase `allVestAt` and then cancel their queued issuance. Since this only costs gas this can be repeated to push `allVestAt` to a very large number effectively delaying all vesting for a very long time.

### Impact

A malicious user can delay issuances a very long time costing only gas.

### Proof of Concept

PoC test in `RToken.test.ts`:

```javascript
    // based on 'Should allow the recipient to rollback minting'
    it('large issuance and cancel griefs later issuances', async function () {
      const issueAmount: BigNumber = bn('5000000e18') // flashloan or rich

      // Provide approvals
      const [, depositTokenAmounts] = await facade.callStatic.issue(rToken.address, issueAmount)
      await Promise.all(
        tokens.map((t, i) => t.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, depositTokenAmounts[i]))
      )

      await Promise.all(
        tokens.map((t, i) => t.connect(addr2).approve(rToken.address, ethers.constants.MaxInt256))
      )
      
      // Get initial balances
      const initialRecipientBals = await Promise.all(tokens.map((t) => t.balanceOf(addr2.address)))

      // Issue a lot of rTokens
      await rToken.connect(addr1)['issue(address,uint256)'](addr2.address, issueAmount)

      // Cancel
      await expect(rToken.connect(addr2).cancel(1, true))
        .to.emit(rToken, 'IssuancesCanceled')
        .withArgs(addr2.address, 0, 1, issueAmount)

      // repeat to make allVestAt very large
      for(let j = 0; j<100 ; j++) {
        await rToken.connect(addr2)['issue(address,uint256)'](addr2.address, issueAmount)

        await expect(rToken.connect(addr2).cancel(1, true))
          .to.emit(rToken, 'IssuancesCanceled')
          .withArgs(addr2.address, 0, 1, issueAmount)
      }

      // Check balances returned to the recipient, addr2
      await Promise.all(
        tokens.map(async (t, i) => {
          const expectedBalance = initialRecipientBals[i].add(depositTokenAmounts[i])
          expect(await t.balanceOf(addr2.address)).to.equal(expectedBalance)
        })
      )
      expect(await facadeTest.callStatic.totalAssetValue(rToken.address)).to.equal(0)

      const instantIssue: BigNumber = MIN_ISSUANCE_PER_BLOCK.sub(1)
      await Promise.all(tokens.map((t) => t.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)))

      // what should have been immediate issuance will be queued
      await rToken.connect(addr1)['issue(uint256)'](instantIssue)

      expect(await rToken.balanceOf(addr1.address)).to.equal(0)

      const issuances = await facade.callStatic.pendingIssuances(rToken.address, addr1.address)
      expect(issuances.length).to.eql(1)
    })
```

### Tools Used

Manual auditing and hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`cancel` could decrease the `allVestAt`. Even though, there's still a small possibility to grief by front running someones issuance with a large `issue`/`cancel` causing their vest to be late, but this is perhaps an acceptable risk as they can then just cancel and re-issue.

## [[M-14] Unsafe cast of `uint8` datatype to `int8`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/265)
*Submitted by [0xTaylor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/265)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L228><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L421>

Converting uint8 to int8 can have unexpected consequences when done unsafely. This issue affects the quote function in BasketHandler.sol and handoutExcessAssets in BackingManager.sol. While there is some risk here, the issue is unlikely to be exploited as ERC-20 tokens generally don't have a decimals value over 18, nevertheless one over 127.

### Proof of Concept

```
➜ int8(uint8(127))
Type: int
├ Hex: 0x7f
└ Decimal: 127
➜ int8(uint8(128))
Type: int
├ Hex: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff80
└ Decimal: -128
```

### Tools Used

Chisel

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Validate that the decimals value is within an acceptable upper-bound before attempting to cast it to a signed integer.

## [[M-15] The `Furnace#melt()` is vulnerable to sandwich attacks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/258)
*Submitted by [wait](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/258)*

Malicious users can get more of the RToken appreciation benefit brought by [`Furnace.sol#melt()`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Furnace.sol#L70), and long-term RToken holders will get less benefit.

RToken holders will be less willing to provide liquidity to RToken pools (such as uniswap pools), resulting in less liquidity of RToken.

### Proof of Concept

**A1. Gain revenue from a flashloan sandwich attack**

A malicious user can launch a flashloan sandwich attack against [Furnace#melt()](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Furnace.sol#L70) each time a whole period passed (payout happens).

The attack transaction execution steps:

1.  Borrow some assets (`inputFund`) with a flashloan
2.  Swap the `inputFund` for RToken
3.  Call [RToken#redeem()](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439) to change the RToken to basket assets(`outputFund`). The `redeem()` will invoke `Furnace.melt()` automatically.
4.  Swap part of `outputFund` for `inputFund` and pay back the flashloan, the rest of `outputFund` is the profit.

The implicit assumption here is that most of the time the prices of RToken in `RToken.issues()`, `RToken.redeem()`, and DeFi pools are almost equal.

This assumption is reasonable because if there are price differentials, they can be balanced by arbitrage.

The attack can be profitable for:

*   `Furnace#melt()` will increase the price of RToken in issue/redeem (according to basket rate).
*   Step 2 buys RTokens at a lower price, and then step 3 sells RTokens at a higher price(`melt()` is called first in `redeem()`).

**A2. Get a higher yield by holding RToken for a short period of time**

Malicious users can get higher yield by by following these steps:

1.  Calculate [the next payout block](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Furnace.sol#L71) of Furnace in advance
2.  Call [RToken#issue()](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L177) 1 to n blocks before the payout block
3.  Call [RToken#redeem()](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439) when the payout block reaches.

Since this approach only requires 1 to n blocks to issue in advance, which is typically much smaller than [rewardPeriod](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2b/docs/system-design.md#rewardperiod), the attacker will obtain much higher APR than long-term RToken holders.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Referring to [eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), distribute rewards based on time weighted shares.

Alternatively, always use a very small rewardPeriod and rewardRatio, and lower the upper limit [MAX_RATIO and MAX_PERIOD](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Furnace.sol#L15-L16).

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L87>

Asset plugins assume underlying collateral tokens will always behave as they are expected at the time of the plugin creation. This assumption can be incorrect because of multiple reasons such as upgrades/rug pulls/hacks.

In case a single collateral token in a basket of assets causes functions in the asset to fail the whole RToken functionality will be broken.

This includes (and not limited to):

1.  Users cannot redeem RTokens for any collateral
2.  Users cannot issue RTokens
3.  Bad collateral token cannot be unregistered
4.  Stakers will not be able to unstake
5.  Recollateralization will not be possible
6.  Basket cannot be updated

The impacts become permanent as the unregistering of bad collateral assets is also dependent on collateral token behavior.

Emphasis of funds lost:<br>
* A basket holds 2 collateral assets \[cAssetA, cAssetB] where cAssetA holds 1% of the RToken collateral and cAssetB holds 99%.
* cAssetA gets hacked and self-destructed. This means it will revert on any interaction with it.
* Even though 99% of funds still exists in cAssetB. They will be permanently locked and RToken will be unusable.

### Proof of Concept

Lets assume a `CTokenFiatCollateral` of `cUSDP` is registered as an asset in `AssetRegistry`.

One day, `cUSDP` deployer gets hacked and the contract self-destructs, therefore any call to the `cUSDP` contract will fail.<br>
`cUSDP` is a proxy contract:<br>
<https://etherscan.io/address/0x041171993284df560249B57358F931D9eB7b925D#readProxyContract>

Note: There could be other reasons that calls to `cUSDP` will revert such as:

1.  Upgrade to implementation to change/deprecate functions
2.  Freezing of contract for a long duration of time (due to patching)
3.  blacklisting/whitelisitng callers.

**Bad collateral assets cannot be unregistered**

Lets describe the flow of unregistering an asset from the `AssetRegistry`:

`governance` needs to call `unregister` in order to unregister and asset:<br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L87>

        function unregister(IAsset asset) external governance {
            require(_erc20s.contains(address(asset.erc20())), "no asset to unregister");
            require(assets[asset.erc20()] == asset, "asset not found");
            uint192 quantity = basketHandler.quantity(asset.erc20());

            _erc20s.remove(address(asset.erc20()));
            assets[asset.erc20()] = IAsset(address(0));
            emit AssetUnregistered(asset.erc20(), asset);

            if (quantity > 0) basketHandler.disableBasket();
        }

As can seen above, `basketHandler.quantity(asset.erc20());` is called as part of the unregister flow.

`quantity` function in `basketHandler`:<br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L300>

        function quantity(IERC20 erc20) public view returns (uint192) {
            try assetRegistry.toColl(erc20) returns (ICollateral coll) {
                if (coll.status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED) return FIX_ZERO;

                uint192 refPerTok = coll.refPerTok(); // {ref/tok}
                if (refPerTok > 0) {
                    // {tok/BU} = {ref/BU} / {ref/tok}
                    return basket.refAmts[erc20].div(refPerTok, CEIL);
                } else {
                    return FIX_MAX;
                }
            } catch {
                return FIX_ZERO;
            }
        }

The asset is still registered so the `try` call will succeed and ` coll.refPerTok(); ` will be called.

`refPerTok` function in `CTokenFiatCollateral` (which is used as an asset of `cUSDP`):<br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/CTokenFiatCollateral.sol#L45>

        function refPerTok() public view override returns (uint192) {
            uint256 rate = ICToken(address(erc20)).exchangeRateStored();
            int8 shiftLeft = 8 - int8(referenceERC20Decimals) - 18;
            return shiftl_toFix(rate, shiftLeft);
        }

If `ICToken(address(erc20)).exchangeRateStored();` will revert because of the previously defined reasons (hack, upgrade, etc..), the whole `unregister` call will be a reverted.

**Explanation of Impact**

As long as the asset is registered and cannot be removed (explained above), many function calls will revert and cause the impacts in the `impact` section.

The main reason is the `refresh` function of `CTokenFiatCollateral` (used for `cUSDP`) depends on a call to `cUSDP` `exchangeRateCurrent` function.<br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/CTokenFiatCollateral.sol#L37>

        function refresh() public virtual override {
            // == Refresh ==
            // Update the Compound Protocol
            ICToken(address(erc20)).exchangeRateCurrent();

            // Intentional and correct for the super call to be last!
            super.refresh(); // already handles all necessary default checks
        }

`AssetRegistry`s `refresh` function calls refresh to all registered assets:<br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L50>

        function refresh() public {
            // It's a waste of gas to require notPausedOrFrozen because assets can be updated directly
            uint256 length = _erc20s.length();
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
                assets[IERC20(_erc20s.at(i))].refresh();
            }
        }

In our case, `CTokenFiatCollateral.refresh()` will revert therefore the call to `AssetRegistry.refresh()` will revert.

`AssetRegistry.refresh()` is called in critical functions that will revert:

1.  `_manageTokens` - used manage backing policy, handout excess assets and perform recollateralization
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L107>)

2.  `refreshBucket` - used to switch the basket configuration
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L184>)

3.  `issue` - used to issue RTokens to depositors
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L194>)

4.  `vest` - used to vest issuance of an account
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L380>)

5.  `redeem` - used to redeem collateral assets for RTokens
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L443>)

6.  `poke` - in main, used as a refresher
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/Main.sol#L45>)

7.  `withdraw` in RSR, stakers will not be able to unstake
(<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L302>)

### Tools Used

Foundry, VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

For plugins to function as intended there has to be a dependency on protocol specific function.

In a case that the collateral token is corrupted, the governance should be able to replace to corrupted token. The unregistering flow should never be depended on the token functionality.

## [[M-17] `refresh()` will revert on Oracle deprecation, effectively disabling part of the protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/234)
*Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/234)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/Asset.sol#L102><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/FiatCollateral.sol#L149><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/OracleLib.sol#L14-L31>

The `Asset.refresh()` function calls `tryPrice()` and catches all errors except errors with empty data.

As explained in the [docs](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/docs/solidity-style.md#catching-empty-data) the reason empty errors aren't caught is in order to prevent an attacker from failing the `tryPrice()` intentionally by running it out of gas.

However, an error with empty data isn't thrown only in case of out of gas, in the current way that Chainlink deprecates oracles (by setting `aggregator` to the zero address) a deprecated oracle would also throw an empty error.

### Impact

Any function that requires refreshing the assets will fail to execute (till the asset is replaced in the asset registry, passing the proposal via governance would usually take 7 days), that includes:

*   Issuance
*   Vesting
*   Redemption
*   Auctions (`manageTokens()`)
*   `StRSR.withdraw()`

### Proof of Concept

The [docs](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/d224c14c398d2727d39d133aa7511e1e6b161833/docs/recollateralization.md#:\~:text=If%20an%20asset%27s%20oracle%20goes%20offline%20forever%2C%20its%20lotPrice\(\)%20will%20eventually%20reach%20%5B0%2C%200%5D%20and%20the%20protocol%20will%20completely%20stop%20trading%20this%20asset.) imply in case of deprecation the protocol is expected continue to operate:

> If an asset's oracle goes offline forever, its lotPrice() will eventually reach \[0, 0] and the protocol will completely stop trading this asset.

The [docs](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/docs/collateral.md#refresh-should-never-revert) also clearly state that '`refresh()` should never revert'

Notes:

*   Chainlink list deprecating oracles only till deprecation, afterwards they're removed from the website. For this reason I wasn't able to trace deprecated oracles on the mainnet
*   I was trying to prove this worked before deprecation, however, I kept getting the 'missing trie node' error when forking the older block. This isn't essential for the PoC so I decided to give up on it for now (writing this PoC was hard enough on its own).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

At `OracleLib.price()` catch the error and check if the error data is empty and the aggregator is set to the zero address, if it is a revert with a custom error. Otherwise revert with the original error data (this can be done with assembly).

Another approach might be to check in the `refresh()` function that the `tryPrice()` function didn't revert due to out of gas error by checking the gas before and after (in case of out of gas error only \~1/64 of the gas-before would be left). The advantage of this approach is that it would catch also other errors that might revert with empty data.

*Submitted by [fs0c](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/211)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L803><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L791>

In `StRSR.sol` the `_domainSeparatorV4` is calculated using the EIP-721 standard, which uses the `name` and `version` that are passed in the init at the function call `__EIP712_init(name, "1");`

Now, governance can change this `name` anytime using the following function:

```solidity
function setName(string calldata name_) external governance {
        name = name_;
    }
```

After that call the domain separator would still be calculated using the old name, which shouldn’t be the case.

### Impact

The permit transactions and vote delegation would be reverted if the domain separator is wrong.

### Recommendation

While changing the name in setName function, update the domain separator.

## [[M-19] In case that `unstakingDelay` is decreased, users who have previously unstaked would have to wait more than `unstakingDelay` for new unstakes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/210)
*Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/210), also found by [Soosh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/151)*

Users who wish to unstake their RSR from StRSR have to first unstake and then wait `unstakingDelay` till they can actually withdraw their stake.

The `unstakingDelay` can change by the governance.

The issue is that when the `unstakingDelay` is decreased - users that have pending unstakes (aka drafts) would have to wait till the old delay has passed for the pending draft (not only for their pending drafts, but also for any new draft they wish to create. e.g. if the unstaking delay was 6 months and was changed to 2 weeks, if a user has a pending draft that was created a month before the change the user would have to wait at least 5 months since the change for every new draft).

### Proof of Concept

The following PoC shows an example similar to above:

*   Unstaking delay was 6 months
*   Bob unstaked (create a draft) 1 wei of RSR
*   Unstaking delay was changed to 2 weeks
*   Both Bob and Alice unstake their remaining stake
*   Alice can withdraw her stake after 2 weeks
*   Bob has to wait 6 months in order to withdraw both that 1 wei and the remaining of the stake

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow users to use current delay even if it was previously higher. I think this should apply not only to new drafts but also for drafts that were created before the change.

Alternatively, the protocol can set a rule that even if the staking delay was lowered stakers have to wait at least the old delay since the change till they can withdraw.  But in this case the rule should apply to everybody regardless if they have pending drafts or not.

## [[M-20] Shortfall might be calculated incorrectly if a price value for one collateral isn't fetched correctly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/200)
*Submitted by [severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/200)*

Function `price()` of an asset doesn't revert. It [returns values](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/Asset.sol#L117) `(0, FIX_MAX)` for `low, high` values of price in case there's a problem with fetching it. Code that calls `price()` is able to validate returned values to detect that returned price is incorrect.

Inside function `collateralShortfall()` of `RecollateralizationLibP1` [collateral price isn't checked for correctness](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L449). As a result incorrect value of `shortfall` might be [calculated](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L452) if there are difficulties to fetch a price for one of the collaterals.

### Proof of Concept

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check that price is correctly fetched for a collateral.

## [[M-21] Loss of staking yield for stakers when another user stakes in pause/frozen state](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/148)
*Submitted by [Soosh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/148), also found by [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/328)*

It is possible for a user to steal the yield from other stakers by staking when the system is paused or frozen.

This is because staking is allowed while paused/frozen, but `_payoutRewards()` is not called during so. Staking rewards are not paid out to current stakers when a new staker stakes, so the new staker immediately gets a portion of the rewards, without having to wait for a reward period.

```sol
function stake(uint256 rsrAmount) external {
	require(rsrAmount > 0, "Cannot stake zero");
	
	if (!main.pausedOrFrozen()) _payoutRewards();
	...
}
```

### Proof of concept

A test case can be included in `ZZStRSR.test.ts` under 'Add RSR / Rewards':

```js
    it('Audit: Loss of staking yield for stakers when another user stakes in pause/frozen state', async () => {
      await rsr.connect(addr1).approve(stRSR.address, stake)
      await stRSR.connect(addr1).stake(stake)

      await advanceTime(Number(config.rewardPeriod) * 5)
      await main.connect(owner).pause()

      await rsr.connect(addr2).approve(stRSR.address, stake)
      await stRSR.connect(addr2).stake(stake)

      await main.connect(owner).unpause()

      await stRSR.connect(addr1).unstake(stake)
      await stRSR.connect(addr2).unstake(stake)
      await advanceTime(Number(config.unstakingDelay) + 1)

      await stRSR.connect(addr1).withdraw(addr1.address, 1)
      await stRSR.connect(addr2).withdraw(addr2.address, 1)
      const addr1RSR = await rsr.balanceOf(addr1.address)
      const addr2RSR = await rsr.balanceOf(addr2.address)
      console.log(`addr1 RSR = ${addr1RSR}`)
      console.log(`addr2 RSR = ${addr2RSR}`)
      expect(Number(addr1RSR)).to.be.approximately(Number(addr2RSR), 10)
    })
```

Note that `await advanceTime(Number(config.rewardPeriod) * 5)` can be before or after the pause, same result will occur.

Run with:<br>
`yarn test:p1 --grep "Audit"`

Output:

```shell
addr1 RSR = 10000545505689818061216
addr2 RSR = 10000545505689818061214

  StRSRP1 contract
    Add RSR / Rewards
      ✔ Audit: Loss of staking yield for stakers when another user stakes in pause/frozen state (1504ms)                                                                                       (1504ms)


  1 passing (2m)
```

The PoC demonstrates that the staker2 stole half of the rewards from staker1. staker1 staked for 5 `rewardPeriod`, staker2 did not have to wait at all, but still received half of the reward share.

### Impact

This should fall into "Theft of unclaimed yield", suggesting High risk. But the amount of RSR that can be stolen depends on the liveliness of the staking pool (how often `_payoutRewards()` is called). If the time window between the last `stake(...)/unstake(...)/payoutRewards(...)` and `pause()/freezeUntil(...)` is small, then no/less RSR yield can be stolen.

`system-design.md` rewardPeriod:

    Default value: `86400` = 1 day
    Mainnet reasonable range: 10 to 31536000 (1 year)

For RTokens which choose a smaller value for `rewardPeriod`, the risk is higher. If `rewardPeriod = 86400` like recommended, then for this attack to occur, no one must have called `stake(...)/unstake(...)/payoutRewards(...)` for 1 day before the pause/freeze occured.

Likelihood is Low for a reasonably set `rewardPeriod` and lively project. Therefore submitting as Medium risk.

### Recommendations

I'm unsure of why staking is allowed when paused/frozen and the reason for the line:

```sol
 if (!main.pausedOrFrozen()) _payoutRewards();
```

The team should consider the reason for the above logic.

If the above logic is required, then I would suggest that `poke()` in `Main.sol` be called inside of `pause()` and `freezeUntil(...)` to update the state **before** pausing/freezing. Since `distribute(...)` has modifier `notPausedOrFrozen`, I would assume in pause/frozen state, no RSR is sent to stRSR contract (i.e. no rewards when paused/frozen) so this recommendation should be sufficient in preventing the issue.

## [[M-22] RecollateralizationLib: Dust loss for an asset should be capped at it's low value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/106)
*Submitted by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/106)*

The `RecollateralizationLib.basketRange` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L152-L202>) internally calls the `RecollateralizationLib.totalAssetValue` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L226-L281>).

I will show in this report that the `RecollateralizationLib.totalAssetValue` function returns a value for `assetsLow` that is too low.

This in turn causes the `range.bottom` value (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L201>) that the `RecollateralizationLib.basketRange` function returns to be too low.

Before showing why the `assetsLow` value is underestimated however I will explain the impact of the `range.bottom` variable being too low.

There are two places where this value is used:

### 1. `RecollateralizationLib.prepareRecollateralizationTrade` function

This function passes the `range` to the `RecollateralizationLib.nextTradePair` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L88-L91>)

Since `range.bottom` is too low, the `needed` amount is too low (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L380>).

This causes the `if` statement to not be executed in some cases when it otherwise would be executed (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L381-L396>).

And the `amtShort` is smaller than it should be (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L391>).

In the end this causes recollateralization trades to not buy as much assets as they could buy. This is because the amount of assets is underestimated so the protocol can actually hold more baskets than it thinks it can.

Therefore underestimating `assetsLow` causes a direct loss to RToken holders because the protocol will not recollateralize the RToken to the level that it can and should.

### 2. Price calculations of `RTokenAsset`

A `RTokenAsset` uses the `RecollateralizationLib.basketRange` function to calculate its value:

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/RTokenAsset.sol#L156>

The `RTokenAsset` therefore underestimates its `low` and `lotLow` prices:

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/RTokenAsset.sol#L58>

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/plugins/assets/RTokenAsset.sol#L99>

This then can lead to issues in any places where the prices of `RTokenAsset`s are used.

### Proof of Concept

Here is the affected line:

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L275>

```solidity
potentialDustLoss = potentialDustLoss.plus(rules.minTradeVolume);
```

This line is executed for every asset in the `AssetRegistry` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L242>).

So for every asset in the `AssetRegistry` a potential dust loss of `minTradeVolume` is added.

The following scenario shows why this is wrong:

    assume minTradeVolume = $50

    assume further the following:
    asset1 with low value $1
    asset2 with low value $1
    asset3 with low value $1
    asset4 with low value $200

    Currently potentialDustLoss will be 4*minTradeVolume = $200.
    So assetsLow = $203 - $200 = $3.

    Dust loss should not be calculated with $50 for the first 3 assets.
    Dust loss for an asset should be capped at its low value.
    So dust loss alltogether should be $1 + $1 + $1 + $50 = $53.

    So assetsLow should be $1+$1+$1+$200 - $53 = $150.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I suggest that an asset can only incur as much dust loss as its balance is.

If the protocol only holds `$5` of asset A then this should not cause a dust loss of say `$10`.

The fix first saves the `assetLow` value which should be saved to memory because it is now needed two times then it caps the dust loss of an asset at its low value:

## [[M-23] StRSR: seizeRSR function fails to update rsrRewardsAtLastPayout variable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/64)
*Submitted by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/64)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L374-L422><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L596-L598><br>
<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L496-L530>

If a RToken is under-collateralized, the `BackingManager` can call the `StRSR.seizeRSR` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L141>).

This sends some amount of `rsr` held by the `StRSR` contract to the `BackingManager` which can then be traded for other tokens in order to recollateralize the RToken.

There are 3 pools of `rsr` in the `StRSR` contract that `StRSR.seizeRSR` claims `rsr` from.

1.  `stakeRSR` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L386-L398>)
2.  `draftRSR` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L401-L414>)
3.  rewards (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L417>)

The `rsr` taken from the rewards is what is interesting in this report.

The issue is that the `StRSR._payoutRewards` function (which is used to pay `rsr` rewards to stakers over time) keeps track of the available rewards to distribute in the `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` variable (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L517>).

When the `StRSR.seizeRSR` function is called (taking away rewards and sending them to the `BackingManager`) and after that `StRSR._payoutRewards` is called, `StRSR._payoutRewards` uses the `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` variable that was set before the seizure (the actual amount of rewards is smaller after the seizure).

Thereby the amount by which `StRSR.stakeRSR` is increased (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L513>) when rewards are paid out can be greater than the actual rewards that are available.

### Proof of Concept and further assessment of Impact

The fact that the `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` variable is too big after a call to `StRSR.seizeRSR` has two consequences when `StRSR._payoutRewards` is called:

1.  `stakeRSR` is increased by an amount that is larger than it should be (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L513>)
2.  `stakeRate` (which uses division by `stakeRSR` when calculated) is smaller than it should be (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L524-L526>)

Both affected variables can in principle be off by a large amount. In practice this is not likely because the rewards paid out will be small in comparison to `stakeRSR`.

Also after a second call to `StRSR._payoutRewards` all variables are in sync again and the problem has solved itself. The excess payouts are then accounted for by the `StRSR.rsrRewards` function.

So there is a small amount of time for any real issue to occur and there does not always occur an issue when `StRSR.seizeRSR` is called.

That being said, the behavior described so far can cause a temporary DOS:

In `StRSR._payoutRewards`, `stakeRSR` is increased (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L513>), then `StRSR.rsrRewards` is called which calculates `rsr.balanceOf(address(this)) - stakeRSR - draftRSR` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L596-L598>).

The falsely paid out amount of rewards can increase `StRSR.stakeRSR` so much that this line reverts due to underflow.

This can cause DOS when `StRSR.seizeRSR` is called again because it internally calls `StRSR.rsrRewards`.

This will solve itself when more `rsr` accumulates in the contract due to revenue which makes the balance increase or someone can just send `rsr` and thereby increase the balance.

The DOS occurs also in all functions that internally call `StRSR._payoutRewards` (`StRSR.stake` and `StRSR.unstake`):

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L215>

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L262>

Overall the impact of this on the average RToken is quite limited but as explained above it can definitely cause issues.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When `StRSR.seizeRSR` is called, the `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` variable should be set to the rewards that are available after the seizure:

## [[M-24] BasketHandler: Users might not be able to redeem their rToken when protocol is paused due to refreshBasket function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/39)
*Submitted by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/39)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514><br>

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L183-L192>

The Reserve protocol allows redemption of rToken even when the protocol is `paused`.

The `docs/system-design.md` documentation describes the `paused` state as:

> all interactions disabled EXCEPT RToken.redeem + RToken.cancel + ERC20 functions + StRSR.stake

Redemption of rToken should only ever be prohibited when the protocol is in the `frozen` state.

You can see that the `RToken.redeem` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514>) has the `notFrozen` modifier so it can be called when the protocol is in the `paused` state.

The issue is that this function relies on the `BasketHandler.status()` to not be `DISABLED` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L448>).

The `BasketHandler.refreshBasket` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L183-L192>) however, which must be called to get the basket out of the `DISABLED` state, cannot be called by any user when the protocol is paused.

When the protocol is paused it can only be called by the governance (OWNER) address.

So in case the basket is `DISABLED` and the protocol is paused, it is the governance that must call `refreshBasket` to allow redemption of rToken.

This is dangerous because redemption of rToken should not rely on governance to perform any actions such that users can get out of the protocol when there is something wrong with the governance technically or if the governance behaves badly.

### Proof of Concept

The `RToken.redeem` function has the `notFrozen` modifier so it can be called when the protocol is paused (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439>).

The `BasketHandler.refreshBasket` function can only be called by the governance when the protocol is paused:

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L186-L190>

```solidity
require(
    main.hasRole(OWNER, _msgSender()) ||
        (status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED && !main.pausedOrFrozen()),
    "basket unrefreshable"
);
```

Therefore the situation exists where rToken redemption should be possible but it is blocked by the `BasketHandler.refreshBasket` function.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `BasketHandler.refreshBasket` function should be callable by anyone when the `status()` is `DISABLED` and the protocol is `paused`.

So the above `require` statement can be changed like this:

    diff --git a/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol b/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol
    index f74155b1..963e29de 100644
    --- a/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol
    +++ b/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol
    @@ -185,7 +185,7 @@ contract BasketHandlerP1 is ComponentP1, IBasketHandler {
     
             require(
                 main.hasRole(OWNER, _msgSender()) ||
    -                (status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED && !main.pausedOrFrozen()),
    +                (status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED && !main.frozen()),
                 "basket unrefreshable"
             );
             _switchBasket();

It was discussed with the sponsor that they might even allow rToken redemption when the basket is `DISABLED`.

In other words only disallow it when the protocol is `frozen`.

This however needs further consideration by the sponsor as it might negatively affect other aspects of the protocol that are beyond the scope of this report.

## [[M-25] BackingManager: rTokens might not be redeemable when protocol is paused due to missing token allowance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/16)
*Submitted by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/16), also found by [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/424)*

<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514><br>

The Reserve protocol allows redemption of rToken even when the protocol is `paused`.

The `docs/system-design.md` documentation describes the `paused` state as:

> all interactions disabled EXCEPT RToken.redeem + RToken.cancel + ERC20 functions + StRSR.stake

Redemption of rToken should only ever be prohibited when the protocol is in the `frozen` state.

The issue is that the `RToken.redeem` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514>) relies on the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L72-L77>) to be called before redemption.

Also the only function that relies on `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` to be called before is `RToken.redeem`.

Therefore `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` can be called at any time before a specific ERC20 needs first be transferred from the `BackingManager` for the purpose of redemption of rToken.

The issue is that the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function has the `notPausedOrFrozen` modifier. This means it cannot (in contrast to `RToken.redeem`) be called when the protocol is `paused`.

Therefore if rToken is for the first time redeemed for a specific ERC20 in a `paused` protocol state, `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` might not have been called before.

This effectively disables redemption of rToken as long as the protocol is `paused` and is clearly against the usability / economic considerations to allow redemption in the `paused` state.

### Proof of Concept

For simplicity assume there is an rToken backed by a single ERC20 called AToken

1.  rToken is issued and AToken is transferred to the `BackingManager`.
2.  The protocol goes into the `paused` state before any redemptions have occurred. So the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function might not have been called at this point.
3.  Now the protocol is `paused` which should allow redemption of rToken but it is not possible because the AToken allowance cannot be granted since the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function cannot be called in the `paused` state.

Another scenario is when the basket of a RToken is changed to include an ERC20 that was not included in the basket before. If the protocol now goes into the `paused` state without `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` being called before, redemption is not possible.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function should use the `notFrozen` modifier instead of the `notPausedOrFrozen` modifier such that allowance can be granted in the `paused` state:

|:--:|:--:|

## [L-01] Melt function should be only callable by the Furnance contract
The function `melt` in RToken.sol is supposed to be called only by Furnace.sol, but as how it is right now the function can be called by anyone. This is problematic considering that this function burns tokens, if a user calls it by mistake. His tokens will be lost and he won't be able to get them back.

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

569:  function melt(uint256 amtRToken) external notPausedOrFrozen {
570:        _burn(_msgSender(), amtRToken);
571:        emit Melted(amtRToken);
572:        requireValidBUExchangeRate();
573:    }
```

Consider applying a require statement in the function `melt` that the msg.sender is the furnance contract:

```solidity
569:  function melt(uint256 amtRToken) external notPausedOrFrozen {
569:        require(_msgSender() == address(furnance), "not furnance contract");
570:        _burn(_msgSender(), amtRToken);
571:        emit Melted(amtRToken);
572:        requireValidBUExchangeRate();
573:    }
```

## [L-02] Stake function shouldn't be accessible, when the status is paused or frozen
The function `stake` in StRSR.sol is used by users to stake a RSR amount on the corresponding RToken to earn yield and over-collateralize the system. If the contract is in paused or frozen status, some of the main functions `payoutRewards`, `unstake`, `withdraw` and `seizeRSR` can't be used. The `stake` function will keep operating but will skip to payoutRewards, this is problematic considering if the status is paused or frozen and a user stakes without knowing that. He won't be able to unstake or call any of the core functions, the only option he has is to wait for the status to be unpaused or unfrozen.

Consider if a contract is in paused or frozen status to turn off all of the core functions including staking as well.

```solidity
contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

212:  function stake(uint256 rsrAmount) external {
213:        require(rsrAmount > 0, "Cannot stake zero");
214:
215:        if (!main.pausedOrFrozen()) _payoutRewards();
216:
217:        // Compute stake amount
218:        // This is not an overflow risk according to our expected ranges:
219:        //   rsrAmount <= 1e29, totalStaked <= 1e38, 1e29 * 1e38 < 2^256.
220:        // stakeAmount: how many stRSR the user shall receive.
221:        // pick stakeAmount as big as we can such that (newTotalStakes <= newStakeRSR * stakeRate)
222:        uint256 newStakeRSR = stakeRSR + rsrAmount;
223:        // newTotalStakes: {qStRSR} = D18{qStRSR/qRSR} * {qRSR} / D18
224:        uint256 newTotalStakes = (stakeRate * newStakeRSR) / FIX_ONE;
225:        uint256 stakeAmount = newTotalStakes - totalStakes;
226:
227:        // Update staked
228:        address account = _msgSender();
229:        stakeRSR += rsrAmount;
230:        _mint(account, stakeAmount);
231:
232:        // Transfer RSR from account to this contract
233:        emit Staked(era, account, rsrAmount, stakeAmount);
234:
235:        // == Interactions ==
236:        IERC20Upgradeable(address(rsr)).safeTransferFrom(account, address(this), rsrAmount);
237:    }
```

## [N-01] Create your own import names instead of using the regular ones
For better readability, you should name the imports instead of using the regular ones.

Example:
```solidity
6: {IStRSRVotes} import "../interfaces/IStRSRVotes.sol";
```

Instances - All of the contracts.

## [N-02] Max value can't be applied in the setters
The function `setTradingDelay` is used by the governance to change the tradingDelay.

However in the require statement applying the maximum delay is not allowed.

Consider changing the require statement to: `require(val < MAX_TRADING_DELAY, "invalid tradingDelay")`

Other instances:

```solidity
contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol

263: function setBackingBuffer

contracts/p1/Broker.sol

133: function setAuctionLength

contracts/p1/Furnace.sol

88: function setPeriod
96: function setRatio

contracts/p1/RToken.sol

589: function setIssuanceRate
602: function setScalingRedemptionRate

contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

812: function setUnstakingDelay
820: function setRewardPeriod
828: function setRewardRatio
```

## [N-03] Using while for unbounded loops isn't recommended
Don't write loops that are unbounded as this can hit the gas limit, causing your transaction to fail.

For the reason above, while and do while loops are rarely used.

```solidity
contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

523: while (_targetNames.length() > 0)

contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

449: while (left < right - 1) {

contracts/p1/StRSRVotes.sol

103: while (low < high) {
```

## [N-04] Inconsistent visibility on the bool "disabled"
In some contracts the visibility of the bool `disabled` is set as private, while on others it is set as public.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

139: bool private disabled;

contracts/p1/Broker.sol

41: bool public disabled;
```

## [N-05] Modifier exists, but not used when needed
In the RToken contract, a lot of private calls are made to `requireNotPausedOrFrozen()` checking if it's paused or frozen.

While there is already modifier used for this purpose in the contract.

function without the modifier:

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

520:  function claimRewards() external {
521:        requireNotPausedOrFrozen();
522:        RewardableLibP1.claimRewards(assetRegistry);
523:    }
```

function with the modifier used:

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

378: function vest(address account, uint256 endId) external notPausedOrFrozen {
```

As you can see there is already modifier with this purpose, but it isn't used on all of the functions.

Consider applying it on the other instances as well.

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

520: function claimRewards
527: function claimRewardsSingle
534: function sweepRewards
541: function sweepRewardsSingle
556: function mint
579: function setBasketsNeeded
```

## [N-06] Unused constructor
The constructor does nothing.

```solidity
contracts/p1/Main.sol

23: constructor() initializer {}

contracts/p1/mixins/Component.sol

25: constructor() initializer {}
```

## [N-07] Unnecessary check in both the \_mint and \_burn function
The function `_mint` and burn in StRSR.sol is called only by someone calling the stake and unstake functions.<br>
A check is made in the functions to ensure the account to mint and burn the amounts isn't address(0).<br>
However this isn't possible as both the stake and unstake function input the address of the msg.sender.<br>
And address(0) can't call this functions, so this checks are unnecessary.

```solidity
contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

694:  function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
695:        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");
696:        assert(totalStakes + amount < type(uint224).max);
697:
698:        stakes[era][account] += amount;
699:        totalStakes += amount;
700:
701:        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
702:        _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
703:    }

708:  function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
709:        // untestable:
710:        //      _burn is only called from unstake(), which uses msg.sender as `account`
711:        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");
712:
713:        mapping(address => uint256) storage eraStakes = stakes[era];
714:        uint256 accountBalance = eraStakes[account];
715:        // untestable:
716:        //      _burn is only called from unstake(), which already checks this
717:        require(accountBalance >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
718:        unchecked {
719:            eraStakes[account] = accountBalance - amount;
720:        }
721:        totalStakes -= amount;
722:
723:        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
724;        _afterTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);
725:    }
```

As you can see in the below instance, everytime the address given to the \_mint and \_burn functions will be the msg.sender of stake and unstake:

```solidity
contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

212:  function stake(uint256 rsrAmount) external {

228:  address account = _msgSender();
229:  stakeRSR += rsrAmount;
230:  _mint(account, stakeAmount);
```

```solidity
contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

257:  function unstake(uint256 stakeAmount) external notPausedOrFrozen {
258:        address account = _msgSender();

267:        _burn(account, stakeAmount);
```

## [R-01] Numeric values having to do with time should use time units for readability
Suffixes like seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks after literal numbers can be used to specify units of time where seconds are the base unit and units are considered naively in the following way:

`1 == 1 seconds`<br>
`1 minutes == 60 seconds`<br>
`1 hours == 60 minutes`<br>
`1 days == 24 hours`<br>
`1 weeks == 7 days`

```solidity
contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol

33: uint48 public constant MAX_TRADING_DELAY = 31536000; // {s} 1 year

contracts/p1/Broker.sol

24: uint48 public constant MAX_AUCTION_LENGTH = 604800; // {s} max valid duration - 1 week

contracts/p1/Furnace.sol

16: uint48 public constant MAX_PERIOD = 31536000; // {s} 1 year

contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

37: uint48 public constant MAX_UNSTAKING_DELAY = 31536000; // {s} 1 year
38: uint48 public constant MAX_REWARD_PERIOD = 31536000; // {s} 1 year
``` 

## [R-02] Use require instead of assert 
The Solidity assert() function is meant to assert invariants.

Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol

110: assert(doTrade);

contracts/p1/mixins/RewardableLib.sol

78: assert(erc20s[i].balanceOf(address(this)) >= liabilities[erc20s[i]]);
102: assert(erc20.balanceOf(address(this)) >= liabilities[erc20]);

contracts/p1/mixins/TradeLib.sol

44: assert(trade.buyPrice > 0 && trade.buyPrice < FIX_MAX && trade.sellPrice < FIX_MAX);
108: assert
168: assert(errorCode == 0x11 || errorCode == 0x12);
170: assert(keccak256(reason) == UIntOutofBoundsHash);

contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol

249: assert(tradesOpen == 0 && !basketHandler.fullyCollateralized());

contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

556: assert(targetIndex < targetsLength);

contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

696: assert(totalStakes + amount < type(uint224).max);
```

Recommended: Consider whether the condition checked in the assert() is actually an invariant.

If not, replace the assert() statement with a require() statement.

## [R-03] Unnecessary overflow check can be rafactored in a better way
In the function `quantityMulPrice` an unchecked code is made, where the local variable `rawDelta` is calculated and after that an if statement is created, where is check if `rawDelta` overflows. This check won't be needed if we just move the variable above the unchecked block, so it will revert if this ever happens.

```solidity
contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

356: function quantityMulPrice(uint192 qty, uint192 p) internal pure returns (uint192) {

365:  unchecked {
366:            // p and mul *are* Fix values, so have 18 decimals (D18)
367:            uint256 rawDelta = uint256(p) * qty; // {D36} = {D18} * {D18}
368:            // if we overflowed *, then return FIX_MAX
369:            if (rawDelta / p != qty) return FIX_MAX;
```

The instance above can be refactored to:

```solidity
356: function quantityMulPrice(uint192 qty, uint192 p) internal pure returns (uint192) {

// rawDelta is moved above the unchecked block and reverts if overflows
364:  uint256 rawDelta = uint256(p) * qty; // {D36} = {D18} * {D18}
365:  unchecked {          
```

## [R-04] If statement should check first, if the status is disabled
The if statement in the function `basketsHeldBy` check first if basket's length equals zero and then checks if the basket is invalid and disabled. Consider first checking if the staus is disabled and then if the length equals zero.

```solidity
432:  function basketsHeldBy(address account) public view returns (uint192 baskets) {
433:        uint256 length = basket.erc20s.length;
434:        if (length == 0 || disabled) return FIX_ZERO;
```

Refactor the instance above to:

```solidity
432:  function basketsHeldBy(address account) public view returns (uint192 baskets) {
433:        uint256 length = basket.erc20s.length;
434:        if (disabled || length == 0) return FIX_ZERO;
```

## [R-05] Some number values can be refactored with `_`
Consider using underscores for number values to improve readability.

```solidity
contracts/p1/Distributor.sol

165:  require(share.rsrDist <= 10000, "RSR distribution too high");
166:  require(share.rTokenDist <= 10000, "RToken distribution too high");
```

The above instance can be refactored to:

```solidity
165:  require(share.rsrDist <= 10_000, "RSR distribution too high");
166:  require(share.rTokenDist <= 10_000, "RToken distribution too high");
```

## [R-06] Revert should be used on some functions instead of return
Some instances just return without doing anything, consider applying revert statement instead with a descriptive string why it does that.

```solidity
contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol

109: if (tradesOpen > 0) return;
114: if (block.timestamp < basketTimestamp + tradingDelay) return;

contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

96: if (weight == FIX_ZERO) return;

contracts/p1/Furnace.sol

71: if (uint48(block.timestamp) < uint64(lastPayout) + period) return;

contracts/p1/RToken.sol

660: if (left >= right) return;
739: if (queue.left == endId) return;

contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

310: if (endId == 0 || firstId >= endId) return;
327: if (rsrAmount == 0) return;
497: if (block.timestamp < payoutLastPaid + rewardPeriod) return;
```

## [R-07] Modifier can be applied on the function instead of creating require statement
If functions are only allowed to be called by a certain individual, modifier should be used instead of checking with require statement, if the individual is the msg.sender calling the function.

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

556:  function mint(address recipient, uint256 amtRToken) external {
557:        requireNotPausedOrFrozen();
558:        require(_msgSender() == address(backingManager), "not backing manager");
559:        _mint(recipient, amtRToken);
560:        requireValidBUExchangeRate();
561:    }
```

Modifier should be created only accessible by the individual and the instance above can be refactored in:

```solidity
556:  function mint(address recipient, uint256 amtRToken) external onlyManager {
557:        requireNotPausedOrFrozen();
558:        _mint(recipient, amtRToken);
559:        requireValidBUExchangeRate();
560:    }
```

Other instances:

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

579: function setBasketsNeeded
```

## [R-08] Shorthand way to write if / else statement
The normal if / else statement can be refactored in a shorthand way to write it:

1. Increases readability
2. Shortens the overall SLOC.

```solidity
contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

296:  function quantity(IERC20 erc20) public view returns (uint192) {
297:        try assetRegistry.toColl(erc20) returns (ICollateral coll) {
298:            if (coll.status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED) return FIX_ZERO;
299:
300:            uint192 refPerTok = coll.refPerTok(); // {ref/tok}
301:            if (refPerTok > 0) {
302:                // {tok/BU} = {ref/BU} / {ref/tok}
303:                return basket.refAmts[erc20].div(refPerTok, CEIL);
304:            } else {
305:                return FIX_MAX;
306:            }
307:        } catch {
308:            return FIX_ZERO;
309:        }
310:    }
```

The above instance can be refactored to:

```solidity
296:  function quantity(IERC20 erc20) public view returns (uint192) {
297:        try assetRegistry.toColl(erc20) returns (ICollateral coll) {
298:            if (coll.status() == CollateralStatus.DISABLED) return FIX_ZERO;
299:
300:            uint192 refPerTok = coll.refPerTok(); // {ref/tok}
301:            returns refPerTok > 0 ? basket.refAmts[erc20].div(refPerTok, CEIL) : FIX_MAX;
302:        } catch {
303:            return FIX_ZERO;
304:        }
305:    }
```

## [R-09] Function should be deleted, if a modifier already exists doing its job
The function `requireNotPausedOrFrozen` is created only to hold the modifier notPausedOrFrozen.<br>
And for this purpose in some functions requireNotPausedOrFrozen is called in order to check if its paused or frozen.<br>
This function isn't necessary as the modifier notPausedOrFrozen can just be applied on the functions.

```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

838: function requireNotPausedOrFrozen() private notPausedOrFrozen {}
```
```solidity
520: function claimRewards() external {
521:        requireNotPausedOrFrozen();
522:        RewardableLibP1.claimRewards(assetRegistry);
523:    }
```

Consider removing `requireNotPausedOrFrozen();` and apply the modifier to the function:

```solidity
520: function claimRewards() external notPausedOrFrozen {
521:        RewardableLibP1.claimRewards(assetRegistry);
522:    }
```

## [R-10] The right value should be used instead of downcasting from uint256 to uint192
In the function `requireValidBUExchangeRate` local variables are used to calculate the outcome of low and high.<br>
After that a require statement is made to ensure the BU rate is in range. The problem is that for the local variables uint256 is used and later in the require statement the value are downcasted to uint192.

```solidity
802:  function requireValidBUExchangeRate() private view {
803:        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
804:        if (supply == 0) return;
805:
806:        // Note: These are D18s, even though they are uint256s. This is because
807:        // we cannot assume we stay inside our valid range here, as that is what
808:        // we are checking in the first place
809:        uint256 low = (FIX_ONE_256 * basketsNeeded) / supply; // D18{BU/rTok}
810:        uint256 high = (FIX_ONE_256 * basketsNeeded + (supply - 1)) / supply; // D18{BU/rTok}
811:
812:        // 1e9 = FIX_ONE / 1e9; 1e27 = FIX_ONE * 1e9
813:        require(uint192(low) >= 1e9 && uint192(high) <= 1e27, "BU rate out of range");
814:    }
```

Consider changing the local variables to use uint192 in the first place, instead of downcasting it:

```solidity
809:        uint192 low = (FIX_ONE_256 * basketsNeeded) / supply; // D18{BU/rTok}
810:        uint192 high = (FIX_ONE_256 * basketsNeeded + (supply - 1)) / supply; // D18{BU/rTok}
811:
812:        // 1e9 = FIX_ONE / 1e9; 1e27 = FIX_ONE * 1e9
813:        require(low >= 1e9 && high <= 1e27, "BU rate out of range");
```

## [O-01] Code contains empty blocks
There are some empty blocks, which are unused. The code should do something or at least have a description why it is structured that way.

```solidity
contracts/p1/Main.sol

64: function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyRole(OWNER) {}
```

Other instances:
```solidity
contracts/p1/RToken.sol

838: function requireNotPausedOrFrozen() private notPausedOrFrozen {}

contracts/p1/mixins/Component.sol

57: function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal view override governance {}
```

## [O-02] Use a more recent pragma version
Old version of solidity is used, consider using the new one `0.8.17`.

You can see what new versions offer regarding bug fixed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md)

Instances - All of the contracts.

## [O-03] Function Naming suggestions
Proper use of `_` as a function name prefix and a common pattern is to prefix internal and private function names with `_`.

This pattern is correctly applied in the Party contracts, however there are some inconsistencies in the libraries.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol

154: function handoutExcessAssets

contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

68: function empty
75: function setFrom
87: function add
356: function quantityMulPrice
650: function requireValidCollArray
```

## [O-04] Events is missing indexed fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain.

Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields.

Instances in:
```solidity
contracts/interfaces/IDistributor.sol

28: event DistributionSet(address dest, uint16 rTokenDist, uint16 rsrDist);

contracts/interfaces/IRToken.sol

83: event BasketsNeededChanged(uint192 oldBasketsNeeded, uint192 newBasketsNeeded);
```

## [O-05] Proper use of get as a function name prefix
Clear function names can increase readability. Follow a standard convertion function names such as using get for getter (view/pure) functions.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol

279: function status
296: function quantity
316: function price
325: function lotPrice
394: function basketTokens
407: function quote

contracts/p1/Distributor.sol

141: function totals

contracts/p1/RToken.sol

596: function scalingRedemptionRate
609: function redemptionRateFloor
621: function issueItem
628: function redemptionLimit

contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

425: function exchangeRate
```

## [O-06] Commented out code
Commented code in the protocol.

Instances:<br>
[L373-L384](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L373-L384)<br>
[L457-L510](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BasketHandler.sol#L457-L510)<br>
[L339-L372](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L339-L372)<br>


## [O-07] Value should be unchecked
The function `_mint` is used to mint tokens to user's accounts.

The storage variable `totalStakes` is an uint256 and there is a check before that preventing it from going overflow.

totalStakes should be unchecked as there is no chance to overflow.

```solidity
contracts/p1/StRSR.sol

694:  function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
695:        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");
696:        assert(totalStakes + amount < type(uint224).max);
697:
698:        stakes[era][account] += amount;
699:        totalStakes += amount;
700:
701:        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
702:        _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
703:    }
```

Consider unchecking totalStakes as how it is done in the `_burn` function as well:

```solidity
694:  function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
695:        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");
696:        assert(totalStakes + amount < type(uint224).max);
697:
698:        stakes[era][account] += amount;
699:        unchecked { totalStakes += amount; }
700:
701:        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
702:        _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
703:    }
```

Total: 457 instances over 30 issues with **36783 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;01] Don't apply the same value to state variables
If `_whenDefault` is already `NEVER`, it'll save 2100 gas to not set it to that value again

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: /contracts/plugins/assets/FiatCollateral.sol

189:             if (sum >= NEVER) _whenDefault = NEVER;

```

## [G&#x2011;02] Multiple `address`/ID mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address`/ID to a `struct`, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **~42 gas per access** due to [not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

*There are 4 instances of this issue. (For in-depth details on this and all further gas optimizations with multiple instances, please see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/391).)*

## [G&#x2011;03] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces the first access in each transaction (Gcoldsload - **2100 gas**) and each access thereafter (Gwarmacces - **100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**). 

While `string`s are not value types, and therefore cannot be `immutable`/`constant` if not hard-coded outside of the constructor, the same behavior can be achieved by making the current contract `abstract` with `virtual` functions for the `string` accessors, and having a child contract override the functions with the hard-coded implementation-specific values.

*There are 6 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;04] State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots
If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (**20000 gas**). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper.

## [G&#x2011;05] Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots
Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (**20000 gas**) for the first setting of the struct. Subsequent reads as well as writes have smaller gas savings.

## [G&#x2011;06] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one.

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved.

*There are 8 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;07] Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a `memory` variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas**) for *each* field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional `MLOAD` rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the `memory` keyword, declaring the variable with the `storage` keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a `memory` variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires `memory`, or if the array/struct is being read from another `memory` array/struct.

## [G&#x2011;08] Avoid contract existence checks by using low level calls
Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, including `EXTCODESIZE` (**100 gas**), to check for contract existence for external function calls. In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value. Similar behavior can be achieved in earlier versions by using low-level calls, since low level calls never check for contract existence.

*There are 67 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;09] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

*There are 60 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;10] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` or `calldata` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata.

## [G&#x2011;11] The result of function calls should be cached rather than re-calling the function
The instances below point to the second+ call of the function within a single function.

*There are 12 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;12] `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables
Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves **[113 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/cbbfb267425b898e5be734d4008d4fe8)**.

*There are 10 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;13] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas
Not inlining costs **20 to 40 gas** because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;14] Add `unchecked {}` for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow because of a previous `require()` or `if`-statement
`require(a <= b); x = b - a` => `require(a <= b); unchecked { x = b - a }`

*There are 6 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;15] `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops
The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves **30-40 gas [per loop](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked)**.

*There are 51 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;16] `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas
Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 [incurs an MSTORE](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#consider-having-short-revert-strings) which costs **3 gas**.

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;17] Optimize names to save gas
`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92).

*There are 49 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;18] Use a more recent version of solidity
- Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.0 to get overflow protection without `SafeMath`
- Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get simple compiler automatic inlining
- Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.3 to get better struct packing and cheaper multiple storage reads
- Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings
- Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value

## [G&#x2011;20] `>=` costs less gas than `>`
The compiler uses opcodes `GT` and `ISZERO` for solidity code that uses `>`, but only requires `LT` for `>=`, [which saves **3 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/3dc79d25acccfa16dee4e83ffdc6ffde).

## [G&#x2011;22] Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas
See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper by **3 gas**.

*There are 15 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;23] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html
Each operation involving a `uint8` costs an extra [**22-28 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/9388d20c70f9a4632eb3ca7836f54977) (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type `uint8`) as compared to ones involving `uint256`, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the `uint8`, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed.

*There are 68 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;24] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

*There are 11 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;25] `require()` or `revert()` statements that check input arguments should be at the top of the function
Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas***) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;26] Empty blocks should be removed or emit something 
The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be `abstract` and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty `if`-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (`if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...}` => `if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}`). Empty `receive()`/`fallback() payable` functions that are not used, can be removed to save deployment gas.

*There are 3 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;27] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.

*There are 25 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;28] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;29] Don't use `_msgSender()` if not supporting EIP-2771
Use `msg.sender` if the code does not implement [EIP-2771 trusted forwarder](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771) support.

*There are 35 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;30] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead
Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public` and [prior to solidity version 0.6.9](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/107939) can save gas by doing so.

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

Total: 260 instances over 9 issues with **68969 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions.

## [G&#x2011;31] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset.

*There are 12 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;32] `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas
Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 [incurs an MSTORE](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#consider-having-short-revert-strings) which costs **3 gas**.

*There are 18 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;33] Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead
```solidity
    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.
```

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (**[100 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/1b70014db712f8572a72378321250058)**) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (**20000 gas**) when changing from `false` to `true`, after having been `true` in the past.

*There are 4 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;34] Using `> 0` costs more gas than `!= 0` when used on a `uint` in a `require()` statement
This change saves **[6 gas](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/zeppelin/original/2X/3/363a367d6d68851f27d2679d10706cd16d788b96.png)** per instance. The optimization works until solidity version [0.8.13](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/bf2c3120f24a69e489f12b3213c06c94) where there is a regression in gas costs.

*There are 11 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;35] `++i` costs less gas than `i++`, especially when it's used in `for`-loops (`--i`/`i--` too)
Saves **5 gas per loop**

## [G&#x2011;36] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

*There are 33 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;37] Division by two should use bit shifting
`<x> / 2` is the same as `<x> >> 1`. While the compiler uses the `SHR` opcode to accomplish both, the version that uses division incurs an overhead of [**20 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec0e4e6c4f52a6bca158f137a3afd4ff) due to `JUMP`s to and from a compiler utility function that introduces checks which can be avoided by using `unchecked {}` around the division by two.

*There are 8 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;38] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.

# Mitigation Review

## Introduction

Following the C4 audit contest, 3 wardens (0xA5DF, HollaDieWaldfee, and [AkshaySrivastav](https://twitter.com/akshaysrivastv)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues. Additional details can be found within the [C4 Reserve Versus Mitigation Review contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest).

## Overview of Changes

**[Summary from the Sponsor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest#overview-of-changes):**

> The sponsors have made many, many changes, in response to the thoughtful feedback from the Wardens. In most cases changes were straightforward and of limited scope, but in at least two cases there were significant reductions or simplifications of large portions of the code. These areas are expanded upon below in their own sections. The 3rd section will cover everything else:
> 
> ### 1. Removal of non-atomic RToken issuance (M-13, M-15)
> 
> [PR #571: remove non-atomic issuance](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/571)
> 
> This audit, as in previous audits ([ToB](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve/blob/main/audits/Trail%20of%20Bits%20-%20Aug%2011%202022.pdf); [Solidified](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve/blob/main/audits/Solidified%20-%20Oct%2016%202022.pdf)) problems were found with the RToken issuance queue, a fussy cumulative data structure that exists to support constant-time `cancel()` and `vest()` operations for non-atomic issuance. This audit too, another issue was discovered with **M-13**. This prompted us to look for alternatives that achieve a similar purpose to the issuance queue, leading to removal of non-atomic issuance entirely and creation of the issuance throttle. The issuance throttle is at a low-level mechanistically similar to the redemption battery from before, except it is a _net hourly issuance_ measure. This addresses the problem of ingesting large amounts of bad collateral too quickly in a different way and with less frictions for users, both in terms of time and gas fees. 
> 
> As wardens will see, large portions of the `RToken` contract code have been removed. This also freed up contract bytecode real estate that allowed us to take libraries internal that were previously external. 
> 
> **Context: Original purpose of issuance queue**
> 
> The original purpose of the issuance queue was to prevent MEV searchers and other unspeakables from depositing large amounts of collateral right before the basket becomes IFFY and issuance is turned off. The overall IFFY -> DISABLED basket flow can be frontrun, and even though the depositer does not know yet whether a collateral token will default, acquiring a position in the queue acts like a valuable option that pays off if it does and has only opportunity cost otherwise. From the protocol's perspective, this kind of issuance just introduces bad debt. 
> 
> The new issunce throttle is purely atomic and serves the same purpose of limiting the loss due to bad debt directly prior to a collateral default. 
> 
> ### 2. Tightening of the basket range formula (H-02, M-20, M-22)
> 
> [PR #585: Narrow bu band](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/585)
> 
> H-02 is the other highly consequential change, from a sheer quantity of SLOC point of view. Indeed, the calculation of the top and bottom of the basket range was highly inefficient and would generally result in larger haircuts than desirable. Below are two datapoints from tests that show the severity of a haircut after default in the absence of RSR overcollateralization:
> 
> - **37.5%** loss +  market-even trades
> - Before: **39.7%** haircut
> - After: **37.52%** haircut
> - **15%** loss + worst-case below market trades
> - Before: **17.87%** haircut
> - After: **16.38%** haircut
> 
> The previous code was more complicated, more costly, and provided worse outcomes. In short this was because it didn't distinguish between capital that needed to be traded vs capital that did not. While the protocol cannot know ahead of time exactly how many BUs it will have after recollateralization, it can use the number of basket units currently held as a bedrock that it knows it will not need to trade, and thus do not differentially contribute to `basket.top` and `basket.bottom`. 
> 
> **Related issues**
> 
> In addition to H-02 this PR also addressed M-20 and M-22, which are related to the calculation of the dust loss and potential overflow during the shortfall calculation. The calculation of the dust loss is now capped appropriately and the shortfall calculation has been eliminated. 
> 
> ### 3. Everything else
> 
> The mitigations for the remaining issues were more narrow in scope. Most do not require further context or description. But there are 2 smaller clusters of changes worth calling out:
> 
> **Universal Revenue Hiding**
> 
> [PR #620: Universal revenue hiding](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/620)
> 
> As a warden pointed out in H-01, there are subtleties that can cause the compound v2 cToken rate to decrease, albeit by extremely little. Since we have dealt with Compund V2 for so long, and only just discovered this detail, we reason there are probably more like it. 
> 
> To this end we've implemented universal revenue hiding at the collateral plugin level, for all appreciating collateral. The idea is that even a small amount of revenue hiding such as 1-part-in-1-million may end up protecting the collateral plugin from unexpected default while being basically undetectable to humans. 
> 
> We mention this change because it can potentially impact other areas of the protocol, such as what prices trades are opened at, or how the basket range is calculated during recollateralization. A warden looking to examine this should focus their attention on `contracts/assets/AppreciatingFiatCollateral.sol`. 
> 
> **Redemption while DISABLED**
> 
> [PR #575: support redemption while disabled](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/575)
> 
> The final change area to bring attention to is the enabling of RToken redemption while the basket is DISABLED. The motivation for this change is not neatly captured in a single contest issue, though it was something discussed with wardens via DM, and which seems tangentially related to issues like M-03.
> 
> Previous behavior: Cannot redeem while DISABLED. `BasketHandler.refreshBasket()` must be called before first redemption can occur, and even then, the redeemer must wait until trading finishes to receive full redemptions. 
> 
> Current behavior: Can redeem while DISABLED. Will get full share of collateral until `BasketHandler.refreshBasket()` is called. Can use `revertOnPartialRedemption` redemption param to control behavior along this boundary. 
> 
> We mention this change because functionality under different basket conditions is central to the functioning of our protocol. RToken redemption is how capital primarily exits the system, so any change to this area is fundamentally risky. 
> 
> A related change is that `BasketHandler._switchBasket()` now skips over IFFY collateral.

| URL | Mitigation of | Purpose | 
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/571 | M-13, M-15 | This PR removes the non-atomic issuance mechanism and adds an issuance throttle. The redemption battery is rebranded to a redemption throttle. |

| https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/615 | M-03, M-04 | This PR allows an RToken redeemer to specify when they require full redemptions vs accept partial (prorata) redemptions. |
| https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/617 | M-02 | This PR prevents paying out StRSR rewards until the StRSR supply is at least 1e18. |

**There were also 3 new medium severity issues surfaced by the wardens. See below for details regarding the new issues as well as issues that were not fully mitigated.**<br>

## [Mitigation of H-02: Issue not fully mitigated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/49)
*Submitted by 0xA5DF*

### Original Issue

H-02: [Basket range formula is inefficient, leading the protocol to unnecessary haircut](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/235)

### Lines of code

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/610cfca553beea41b9508abbfbf4ee4ce16cbc12/contracts/p1/mixins/RecollateralizationLib.sol#L146-L245

### Not mitigated - top range can still be too high, leading to unnecessary haircut
* The applied mitigation follows the line of the mitigation suggested (disclosure: by me :)) in the original issue, however after reviewing it I found out that it doesn't fully mitigate the issue.
* The original issue was that basket range band is too wide, with both top range being too high and bottom range too low
* The bottom range is mitigated now
* As for the top range - even though it's more efficient now, it still can result in a top range that doesn't make sense.

### Impact
Protocol might go for an unnecessary haircut, causing a loss for RToken holders.
In the scenario below we can trade to get ~99% of baskets needed, but instead the protocol goes for a 50% haircut.

After the haircut the baskets held per supply ratio might grow back via `handoutExcessAssets` and `Furnace` however:
* Not all excess asset goes to `Furnace`
* `Furnace` grows slowly over time and in the meantime
    * Redemption would be at the lower baskets per supply
    * New users can issue in the meanwhile, diluting the melting effect

In more extreme cases the baskets held can be an extremely low number that might even cause the haircut to fail due to `exchangeRateIsValidAfter` modifier on `setBasketsNeeded()`. This would mean trading would be disabled till somebody sends enough balance to the undercollateralized asset.

### Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario:
* A basket is composed of 30 USDc and 1 ETH
* The prices are:
    * 1 USDc = 1 USD
    * ETH = 1500 USD
* Therefore the total basket value is 1515 USD
* Protocol holds 1000 baskets
* Governance changes the USDC quantity to 30 USDC
* Baskets held now is only 500, since we hold only 15K USDC
* Bottom range would be `basketsHeld + (excess_ETH * ETH_lowPrice / basket_highPrice) = 500 + (1500 * 500 * 0.99 / (1530 * 1.01)) = 980`
* Top range would be `basketsHeld + (excess_ETH * ETH_highPrice / basket_lowPrice) = 500 + (1500 * 500 * 1.01 / (1530 * 0.99)) = 1000`
* This is clearly a wrong estimation, which would lead to a haircut of 50% (!) rather than going for a trade.

Note: I mentioned governance change for simplicity, but this can also happen without governance intervention when a collateral gets disabled, it's value declines and a backup asset kicks in (at first the disabled asset would get traded and cover up some of the deficit and then we'd go for a haircut)

### Mitigation
* A more efficient formula would be to use the max baskets held (i.e. the maximum of (each collateral balance divided by the basket_quantity of that collateral)) and then subtract from that the lowest estimation of baskets missing (i.e. lowest value estimation of needed assets to reach that amount divided by highest estimation of basket value).
    * In the case above that would mean `maxBasketsHeld - (USDC_deficit * USDC_lowPrice / basket_highPrice) = 1000 - (500 * 30 * 0.99 / (1530 * 1.01)) = 990.4`. Freeing up 9.6 ETH for sale
* The suggested formula might get us a higher top range estimation when the case is the other way around (the collateral that makes the larger part of the basket value is missing, in our case ETH is missing and USDC not), but it wouldn't result in a haircut and still go for trading (since the top range would be closer to baskets held)


Even with the mitigation above there can be extreme cases where a single asset holds a very small fraction of the total basket value (e.g. 0.1%) and the mitigation wouldn't help much in this case. There might be a need to come up with a broader mitigation for the issue that haircut is done to the number of baskets held rather than bottom range even though the difference between the two can be significant. Or set a threshold for the fraction of the value that each collateral holds in the total value of the basket.

 > Confirming, but I believe this issue can only arise when the basket unit is increased in `{UoA}` terms. Can someone confirm this? Does the issue exist when a basket unit is simply allocated differently, as opposed to being increased in size?

 > >  Does the issue exist when a basket unit is simply allocated differently
> 
> Usually when it's only allocated differently the asset which was decreased in quantity would be used to cover up for the asset that was increased (since top range is capped to baskets needed, the decreased asset would have a surplus). However there can be a scenario under difference in allocation:
> * Asset A (worth 1515 USD) was switched to mostly asset B (1 ETH as above) and some of asset C (quantity increased from 15 USDC to 30 USDC)
> * All of asset A was traded for asset B first (since asset B is missing more in value + oracle error caused a 1% difference in price)
> * We're now facing the same issue as above - we've got 100% of basket B
> 
> Plus, as mentioned above this can also happen when a collateral gets disabled, went down in value and was switched to backup collateral

> As I mentioned in some edge cases the issue still might persist. Maybe as part of the mitigation we should also don't do a haircut to an amount that's significantly lower than the bottom range.<br>
> E.g. if the baskets held is 50% (of needed baskets) and bottom range is 98% we should do a haircut only down to 95% (and hopefully in the next round there are more chances we'll be able to trade).

## [Mitigation of M-04: Issue not fully mitigated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/54)
*Submitted by 0xA5DF, also found by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/14) and [AkshaySrivastav](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/69)*

### Original Issue

M-04: [Redemptions during undercollateralization can be hot-swapped to steal all funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/399)

### Lines of code

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/610cfca553beea41b9508abbfbf4ee4ce16cbc12/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L215

### Impact

User might be agreeing to a partial redemption expecting to lose only a small fraction, but end up losing a significantly higher fraction.

**Details**

* Issue was that user might get only partial redemption when they didn't intend to - they sent a tx to the pool, in the meanwhile an asset got disabled and replaced. Redeemer doesn't get any share of the disabled collateral, and the backup collateral balance is zero.
* Mitigation adds a parameter named `revertOnPartialRedemption`, if the parameter is false the redeeming would revert if any collateral holds only part of the asset.
* This is suppose to solve this issue since in the case above the user would set it to false and the redeeming tx would revert
* The issue is that there might be a case where the protocol holds only a bit less than the quantity required (e.g. 99%), and in that case the user would be setting `revertOnPartialRedemption` to true, expecting to get 99% of the value of the basket. Then if an asset is disabled and replaced the user would suffer a loss much greater than they've agreed to.

### Proof of Concept

**Likelihood**
Mostly the protocol wouldn't be undercollateralized for a long time, since there would either by trading going on to cover it or eventually there would be a haircut. But there can still be periods of time where this happens:
* Governance increased the basket quantity of one asset a bit (expecting the yield to cover for it), trading won't start till `tradingDelay` passes. Meaning a few hours where only partial redemption would be possible.
* Another asset got disabled first, and replaced by a backup asset. The protocol either had enough balance of the backup asset or covered up for it via trading. Yet again, this won't last long since eventually all trading would complete and the protocol would go to a haircut, but there can be multiple trading of multiple assets which would make it last up to a few hours.

### Mitigation
The ideal solution would be to allow the user to specify the min amount for each asset or the min ratio of the between the total redemption value and the basket value, but that would be too expensive and complicated.
I think the middle way here would be to replace `revertOnPartialRedemption` parameter with a single numeric parameter that specifies the min ratio that the user expects to get (i.e. if that parameter is set to 90%, that means that if any asset holds less than 90% than the quantity it should the redemption would revert).
This shouldn't cost much more gas, and would cover most of the cases.

### Impact
An early attacker can DOS the `issue` functionality in the `RToken` contract.  

No issuances can be made. And the DOS cannot be recovered from. It is permanent.  

### Proof of Concept
You can add the following test to the `Furnace.test.ts` file and execute it with `yarn hardhat test --grep 'M-05 Mitigation Error: DOS issue'`.  

```typescript
describe('M-05 Mitigation Error', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
      // Approvals for issuance
      await token0.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      await token1.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      await token2.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      await token3.connect(addr1).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)

      await token0.connect(addr2).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      await token1.connect(addr2).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      await token2.connect(addr2).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)
      await token3.connect(addr2).approve(rToken.address, initialBal)

      // Issue tokens
      const issueAmount: BigNumber = bn('100e18')
      // await rToken.connect(addr1).issue(issueAmount)
      // await rToken.connect(addr2).issue(issueAmount)
    })

    it('M-05 Mitigation Error: DOS issue', async () => {
      /* attack vector actually so bad that attacker can block issuance a loooong time?
      */
      console.log("Total supply");
      console.log(await rToken.totalSupply());

      const issueAmount: BigNumber = bn('1e17')
      await rToken.connect(addr1).issue(issueAmount)

      console.log("Total supply");
      console.log(await rToken.totalSupply());

      const transferAmount: BigNumber = bn('1e16')
      rToken.connect(addr1).transfer(furnace.address, transferAmount);

      await advanceTime(3600);

      await furnace.connect(addr1).melt()
      
      await advanceTime(3600);

      console.log("rToken balance of furnace");
      console.log(await rToken.balanceOf(furnace.address));

      /* rToken can not be issued
      */

      await expect(rToken.connect(addr1).issue(issueAmount)).to.be.revertedWith('rToken supply too low to melt')

      console.log("rToken balance of furnace");
      console.log(await rToken.balanceOf(furnace.address));

      /* rToken can not be issued even after time passes
      */

      await advanceTime(3600);

      await expect(rToken.connect(addr1).issue(issueAmount)).to.be.revertedWith('rToken supply too low to melt')

      /* rToken.melt cannot be called directly either
      */

      await expect(rToken.connect(addr1).melt(transferAmount)).to.be.revertedWith('rToken supply too low to melt')
    })
  })
```

The attack performs the following steps:  

1. Issue `1e17` rToken
2. Transfer `1e16` rToken to the furnace
3. Wait 12 seconds and call `Furnace.melt` such that the furnace takes notice of the transferred rToken and can pay them out later
4. Wait at least 12 seconds such that the furnace would actually call `RToken.melt`
5. Now `RToken.issue` and `RToken.melt` are permanently DOSed

### Tools Used
VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use a try-catch block for `furnace.melt` in the `RToken.issueTo` function.  

```diff
diff --git a/contracts/p1/RToken.sol b/contracts/p1/RToken.sol
index 616b1532..fc584688 100644
--- a/contracts/p1/RToken.sol

         require(basketHandler.status() == CollateralStatus.SOUND, "basket unsound");
 
-        furnace.melt();
+        try main.furnace().melt() {} catch {}
         uint256 supply = totalSupply();
 
         // Revert if issuance exceeds either supply throttle
```

The only instance when `furnace.melt` reverts is when the `totalSupply` is too low. But then it is ok to catch the exception and just continue with the issuance and potentially lose rToken appreciation.  

Potentially losing some rToken appreciation is definitely better than having this attack vector.  

The `RToken.redeemTo` function already has the call to the `furnance.melt` function wrapped in a try-catch block. So redemption cannot be DOSed.

## [AssetRegistry cannot disable a bad asset](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/73)
*Submitted by AkshaySrivastav*

### Original Issue

M-16: [RToken permanently insolvent/unusable if a single collateral in the basket behaves unexpectedly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/254)

### Lines of code

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L91-L104


### Impact
The AssetRegistry contains an `unregister` function which can be used to detach a bad collateral from the RToken system.

Previously [M-16](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/254) was reported as an issue for the RToken system in which a single bad collateral can stop the working of RToken protocol.

To fix M-16, the `basketHandler.quantity` call was wrapped in a `try/catch` block so that the statement can handle any unexpected revert from the collateral contract.

While the fix handles unexpected reverts, it misses the case which the `basketHandler.quantity` call may consume the entire transaction gas.

So, if for some reasons the Collateral contract start consuming more gas than the allowed block gas limit, the `basketHandler.quantity` call will always fail, resulting in the revert of `unregister` call.

This essentially prevent governance from unregistering a collateral from the RToken. The unregistering of a collateral is still dependent upon the code execution of the collateral token contract.


### Proof of Concept
Consider this scenario:

 - TokenA was registered as an asset in AssetRegistry.
 - Due to an upgrade/bug/hack the TokenA starts consuming all available gas on function calls.
 - The RToken governance decides to unregister the TokenA asset and calls the `AssetRegistry.unregister` function.
 - Internal call chain invokes any function of TokenA contract. The txn reverts with an out of gas error.
 - The governance is now unable to unregister TokenA from RToken protocol and RToken is now unusable.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider detaching the interaction with collateral contract completely from the unregistering contract flow. Unregistering a contract must never depend upon the code execution of Collateral token contract.

## [StRSR: attacker can steal excess rsr that is returned after seizure](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/17)
*Submitted by HollaDieWaldfee, also found by [AkshaySrivastav](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/48)*

**Severity: Medium**

### Lines of code

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L176-L182<br>
https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L496-L530


### Vulnerability details

**Note:**<br>
This issue deals with excess `rsr` that was seized from `stRSR` but is returned again.<br>
The `M-12` issue also deals with excess `rsr`.  

However `M-12` deals with the fact that not all `rsr` is returned to `stRSR`, whereas this issue deals with the fact that an attacker can steal `rsr` once it is returned to `stRSR`.  

So while the issues seem to be similar they in fact are different.  

They are separate issues. So I chose to report this separately with the `NEW` keyword.  

### Impact
`rsr` can be returned to `stRSR` after a seizure if not all seized `rsr` has been necessary to regain full collateralization.  

This happens in the [`BackingManger.handoutExcessAssets`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L176-L182) function.  

This excess `rsr` is then paid out to ALL stakers just like regular `rsr` rewards using the [`StRSR._payoutRewards`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/StRSR.sol#L496-L530) function.  

This is unfair. An attacker can abuse this behavior and stake `rsr` to profit from the returned `rsr` which is used to appreciate his `stRSR`.  

It would be fair if the `rsr` was returned only to the users that had staked when the seizure occurred.  

### Proof of Concept
Think of the following scenario:  

1. There are currently 100 stakers with an equal share of the `1000 rsr` total that is currently in the `stRSR` contract.  
2. A seizure occurs and `500 rsr` are seized.
3. Not all `rsr` is sold and some (say `50 rsr`) is returned to `StRSR`
4. The attacker can front-run the transaction that returns the `rsr` and become a staker himself
5. The attacker will profit from the returned `rsr` once it is paid out as reward. Say the attacker stakes `100 rsr`. He now owns a share of `100 rsr / (500 rsr + 100 rsr) = 20%`. This means he will also get `20%` of the `50 rsr` that are paid out as rewards.  

### Tools Used
VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Ideally, as I said above, the `rsr` should be returned only to the users that had staked when the seizure occurred.  

With the current architecture of the `stRSR` contract this is not possible. There is no way to differentiate between stakers.  

Also the scenario described is an edge and relies on a seizure to occur and `rsr` to be returned.  

It seems unrealistic that `10%` of the seized `rsr` is returned again. I think a number like `1% - 5%` is more realistic.  

But still if the amount of `rsr` that is seized is big enough, `1% - 5%` can be a significant amount in terms of dollar value.  

I estimate this to be `Medium` severity since an attacker can profit at the expense of other stakers and this behavior will decrease the willingness of users to stake as the risk of losing funds is increased.  

This severly damages the incentives involved with staking. Stakers are incentivized to wait for seizures to occur and only then stake as they might profit from returned `rsr`.  

I encourage the sponsor to further assess if there is a better way to return excess `rsr`.

## [Attacker can temporary deplete available redemption/issuance by running issuance then redemption or vice versa](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/79)

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/610cfca553beea41b9508abbfbf4ee4ce16cbc12/contracts/libraries/Throttle.sol#L66-L75

### Impact
Attacker can deplete available issuance or redemption by first issuing and then redeeming in the same tx or vice versa.<br>
The available redemption/issuance will eventually grow back, but this temporary reduces the available amount.<br>
This can also use to front run other user who tries to redeem/issue in order to fail their tx. 

### Proof of Concept
In the PoC below a user is able to reduce the redemption available by more than 99% (1e20 to 1e14), and that's without spending anything but gas (they end up with the same amount of RToken as before)

}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Mitigating this issue seems a bit tricky.

One way is at the end of `currentlyAvailable()` to return the max of `available` and `throttle.lastAvailable` (up to some limit, in order not to allow to much of it to accumulate).

### Impact
The assets that back the rTokens are held by the `BackingManager` and can earn rewards.  

The rewards can be claimed via the [`TradingP1.claimRewards`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/mixins/Trading.sol#L82-L84) and [`TradingP1.claimRewardsSingle`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/mixins/Trading.sol#L90-L92) function.  

The `BackingManager` inherits from `TradingP1` and therefore the above functions can be used to claim rewards.  

The issue is that the `BackingManager` does not claim rewards as part of its [`_manageTokens`](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/27a3472d553b4fa54f896596007765ec91941348/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L105-L153) function.  

So recollateralization can occur before rewards have been claimed.  

There exist possibilities how an attacker can exploit this to cause a loss to rToken holders and rsr stakers.  

### Proof of Concept
Let's think about an example for such a scenario:  

Assume that the `RToken` is backed by a considerable amount of `TokenA`

`TokenA` earns rewards but not continuously. Bigger amounts of rewards are paid out periodically. Say 5% rewards every year.  

Assume further that the `RToken` is currently undercollateralized.  

The attacker can now front-run the claiming of rewards and perform recollateralization.  

The recollateralization might now seize `rsr` from stakers or take an unnecessary haircut.  

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
I suggest that the `BackingManager._manageTokens` function calls `claimRewards`. Even before it calculates how many baskets it holds:
