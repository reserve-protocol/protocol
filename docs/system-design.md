# System Design

## Overview of Contract Architecture

The protocol is split into core contracts and plugins.

The _core_ contracts include `Main` and the other contracts (`Component`s) directly registered by `Main`. The core contracts all share governance and pausing status, they're all upgradable, and they form a single security domain.

The _plugin_ contracts are intended to be individual, static contracts that can be _registered_ with the core contracts. This includes the `Asset` and `Collateral` contracts that are registered in `AssetRegistry`, and `Trade` contracts that are selected and created by the `Broker`. Plugin contracts have only short-term state, are not individually pausable, and are not upgradable; if a plugin contract must be upgraded, it can simply be replaced.

Any ERC20 token that our system knows how to deal with is wrapped and modelled in an `Asset` or `Collateral` contract. An Asset models an ERC20 token, and provides a view of its price against the unit of account. A Collateral is an Asset with the further information our protocol requires to use its ERC20 as RToken backing.

The remained solidity files in our repository are either:

- `Facade.sol` and `FacadeAct.sol`, which is a stateless generic interface that can be used with any RToken. This enables convenient external interactions and app development. There can be multiple facades.
- `FacadeWrite.sol`, which allows to easily deploy and configure an RToken in a few simple transactions.
- `Deployer.sol`, which deploys the clones of implementation contracts as needed to initialize a new RToken
- `Fixed.sol`, which provides fixed-point fractional arithmetic operations
- Mixins for the implementations of the other contracts in the system
- Mocks or stubs for testing

## Notes on Token Flow

### Tokens Held by Different Contracts

Some of the core contracts in our system regularly own ERC20 tokens. In each case, such tokens are intended for particular purposes:

- `BackingManager`: Holds all collateral tokens backing outstanding RToken
- `RToken`: Holds collateral tokens for RToken where issuance has begun but is not yet vested
- `Furnace`: Holds revenue RToken to be melted
- `stRSR`: Holds staked RSR
- `RevenueTrader`: Holds and trades some asset A for RSR (for stRSR rewards) or RToken (for melting)

### RToken Lifecycle

1. During SlowIssuance, the `RToken` transfers collateral tokens from the caller's address into itself.
2. At vesting time, the `RToken` contract mints new RToken to the recipient and transfers the held collateral to the `BackingManager`. If the `BasketHandler` has updated the basket since issuance began, then the collateral is instead returned to the recipient and no RToken is minted.
3. During redemption, RToken is burnt from the redeemer's account and they are transferred a prorata share of backing collateral from the `BackingManager`.

## Some Monetary Units

Our system refers to units of financial value in a handful of different ways, and treats them as different dimensions. Some of these distinctions may seem like splitting hairs if you're just thinking about one or two example RTokens, but the differences are crucial to understanding how the protocol works in a wide variety of different settings.

Some units:

- Unit of Account `{UoA}`: Any particular RToken must have a single Unit of Account. This unit is used internally to compare the values of different assets, as when deciding when there's enough revenue to start an auction, or in which of several surplus assets we hold the largest surplus.

- Target unit `{target}`: Outside of default, each collateral in an RToken basket is expected to be stable or appreciating against some exogenous currency. The exogenous currency is that collateral's _target unit_. We expect that in many RTokens that people actually want, all of those target units will be the same, and we can speak of the RToken maintaining stability or appreciation against _its_ target unit.

- Reference unit `{ref}`: When collateral tokens are expected to appreciate, it's generally because some defi protocol (or protocols) produces a token that is freely redeemable for some base token, and that redemption rate is expected to monotonically increase over time. That base token is the _reference unit_ for the collateral token. The RToken protocol expects reference units to be in a known, predictable relationship with target units, and will flag a collateral token as defaulting if that relationship appears to be broken.

- Token `{tok}`: A token that our protocol holds a balance of, mostly as backing for the RToken.

Some examples:

- For a Compound collateral token such as cUSDC, the unit of account is USD, the reference unit USDC and target unit USD.
- For an Aave collateral token such as aUSDP, the unit of account is USD, the reference token USDP and target unit USD.

- Let's say we're building a pure-stable USD basket, out of USDC, USDP, and DAI. The unit of account would surely be USD. Each collateral token would also be its own reference unit, and its target would be USD.

- Perhaps we're interested in a USD-denominated basket of blue-chip cryptocurrencies. This type of rToken could be a 50/50 basket of wstETH and yvwBTC, where the reference units could be ETH and wBTC, respectively. The target units would then be ETH & BTC, while the `{UoA}` would be USD. Thus, the _value_ of the rToken would fluctuate (according to its unit-of-account), but all other necessary properties could be maintained.

Separate from these, a number in dimension `{BU}` ("basket units") is an amount of current baskets.

### Regarding `{UoA}` and `{target}`

While it will usually be the case that a collateral's `{target}` will be the same as its RToken's `{UoA}`, this is by no means a requirement. The `{UoA}` is a way to value the RToken and its collateral in terms of a single unit, while each collateral's `{target}` is the expected value of its liability, or its `{ref}`. As in example #3 above, an RToken's collaterals may have completely different `{target}` units, but be valued by the same `{UoA}`.

## Basket Dynamics

There are 3 types of baskets in our system:

1. Prime Basket (Configuration parameter, changed only by governance action)
2. Reference Basket (Contract state, changes rarely)
3. Collateral Basket (Dynamic value)

### Prime Basket

The prime basket is directly set by governance, and only changes when governance demands it. The prime basket consists of a set of triples `<collateral token, target unit, target amount>`. Each triple means that, in each basket unit, `target amount` of the `target unit` should be represented by `collateral token`.

The dimension of `target amount` is `{target / BU}`.

For example, if the prime basket contains the triple `<cUSDC, USD, 0.33>`, that means "The configured system should contain 0.33 USD/BU, as represented by cUSDC".

As a consequence, the prime basket also defines the quantity of each target unit that's intended to be represented by one basket; altogether, these pairs `<target unit, target amount>` form the _target basket_. The target basket isn't used explicitly anywhere in our code, but it's a useful property of a proposed RToken. (e.g, "A target basket of 1 USD, 1 EUR, and 1/1000th ETH".)

### Reference Basket

Whenever the BasketHandler derives a new concrete basket from the prime basket (by calling `BasketHandler._switchBasket()`), the persistent value it saves is the _reference basket_. (This happens whenever a token defaults, or governance manually requests a switch.)

A reference basket is a set of triples `<collateral token, reference unit, reference amount>`. Each triple means that each basket unit must contain an amount of `collateral token` currently equivalent to `reference amount` of the `reference unit`.

The dimension of `reference amount` is `{ref/BU}`.

For example, if the reference basket contains the triple `<cUSDC, USDC, 0.33>`, then one basket unit should contain whatever amount of cUSDC is redeemable in its protocol for 0.33 USDC.

### Collateral Basket

The collateral basket is derived, moment-by-moment and on-demand, from the reference basket. Since defi redemption rates can change every transaction, so can the collateral basket. The collateral basket is a set of pairs `<collateral token, token amount>`. Each pair means that each basket unit must contain `token amount` of `collateral token`.

The dimension of `token amount` is `{tok/BU}`.

For instance, if the reference basket contains the pair `<cUSDC, O.29>`, then one basket unit will contain 0.29 cUSDC.

This is the form of the basket that recipients and redeemer will care most about. Issuance and redemption quantities are given by the collateral basket times the current `rTok/BU` exchange rate.

While an issuance is pending in the mempool, the quantities of tokens that will be ingested when the transaciton is mined may decrease slightly as the collateral becomes worth more. If furnace melting happens in that time, however, this can increase the quantity of collateral tokens in the basket and cause the issuance to fail.

On the other hand, while a redemption is pending in the mempool, the quantities of collateral tokens the redeemer will receive steadily decreases. If a furnace melting happens in that time the quantities will be increased, causing the redeemer to get more than they expected.

## System States

- `paused`: all interactions disabled EXCEPT ERC20 functions + RToken.redeem + StRSR.stake + StRSR.payoutRewards
- `frozen`: all interactions disabled EXCEPT ERC20 functions + StRSR.stake

Freezing can occur over two timescales: short freezing + long freezing.

Non-owner roles:

- `PAUSER`
- `SHORT_FREEZER`
- `LONG_FREEZER`

Design intentions:

- The PAUSER role should be assigned to an address that is able to act quickly in response to off-chain events, such as a Chainlink feed failing. It is acceptable for there to be false positives, since redemption remains enabled.
- The SHORT_FREEZER role should be assigned to an address that might reasonably be expected to be the first to detect a bug in the code and can act quickly, and with some tolerance for false positives though less than in pausing. If a bug is detected, a short freeze can be triggered which will automatically expire if it is not renewed by LONG_FREEZER. The OWNER (governance) may also step in and unfreeze at anytime.
- The LONG_FREEZER role should be assigned to an address that will highly optimize for no false positives. It is much longer than the short freeze. It exists so that in the case of a zero-day exploit, governance can act before the system unfreezes and resumes functioning.

## System Auctions

The Reserve Protocol makes a few different types of trades:

- from collateral to RSR or RToken, in order to distribute collateral yields. These happen often.
- from reward tokens to RSR or RToken, in order to distribute tokens rewards from collateral. These also happen often.
- collateral to collateral, in order to change the distribution of collateral due to a basket change. Basket changes should be rare, happening only when governance changes the basket, or when some collateral token defaults.
- RSR to collateral, in order to recollateralize the protocol from stRSR over-collateralization, after a basket change. These auctions should be even rarer, happening when there's a basket change and insufficient capital to achieve recollateralization without using the over-collateralization buffer.

Each type of trade can currently happen in only one way; the protocol launches a Gnosis EasyAuction. The Reserve Protocol is designed to make it easy to add other trading methods, but none others are currently supported.

A good explainer for how Gnosis auctions work can be found (on their github)[https://github.com/gnosis/ido-contracts].

## Deployment Parameters

### `dist` (revenue split)

The fraction of revenues that should go towards RToken holders vs stakers, as given by the relative values of `dist.rTokenDist` and `dist.rsrDist`. This can be thought of as a single variable between 0 and 100% (during deployment).

Default value: 60% to stakers and 40% to RToken holders.
Mainnet reasonable range: 0% to 100%

### `minTradeVolume`

Dimension: `{UoA}`

The minimum sized trade that can be performed, in terms of the unit of account.

Setting this too high will result in auctions happening infrequently or the RToken taking a haircut when it cannot be sure it has enough staked RSR to succeed in rebalancing at par.

Setting this too low may allow griefers to delay important auctions. The variable should be set such that donations of size `minTradeVolume` would be worth delaying trading `auctionLength` seconds.

This variable should NOT be interpreted to mean that auction sizes above this value will necessarily clear. It could be the case that gas frictions are so high that auctions launched at this size are not worthy of bids.

This parameter can be set to zero.

Default value: `1e22` = $10k
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e19 to 1e23

#### `rTokenMaxTradeVolume`

Dimension: `{UoA}`

The maximum sized trade for any trade involving RToken, in terms of the unit of account. The high end of the price is applied to this variable to convert it to a token quantity.

This parameter can be set to zero.

Default value: `1e24` = $1M
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e22 to 1e27.

### `rewardRatio`

Dimension: `{1}`

The `rewardRatio` is the fraction of the current reward amount that should be handed out per span of 12s.

Default value: `3209014700000` = a half life of 30 days at a period of 12s.

Mainnet reasonable range: 1e11 to 1e13

To calculate: `ln(2) / (60*60*24*desired_days_in_half_life/12)`, and then multiply by 1e18.

### `unstakingDelay`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The unstaking delay is the number of seconds that all RSR unstakings must be delayed in order to account for stakers trying to frontrun defaults. It must be longer than governance cycle, and must be long enough that RSR stakers do not unstake in advance of foreseeable basket change in order to avoid being expensed for slippage.

Default value: `1209600` = 2 weeks
Mainnet reasonable range: 1 to 31536000

### `tradingDelay`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The trading delay is how many seconds should pass after the basket has been changed before a trade can be opened. In the long term this can be set to 0 after MEV searchers are firmly integrated, but at the start it may be useful to have a delay before trading in order to avoid worst-case prices.

Default value: `21600` = 6 hours
Mainnet reasonable range: 0 to 604800

### `auctionLength`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The auction length is how many seconds long Gnosis EasyAuctions should be.

Default value: `900` = 15 minutes
Mainnet reasonable range: 60 to 3600

### `backingBuffer`

Dimension: `{1}`

The backing buffer is a percentage value that describes how much additional collateral tokens to keep in the BackingManager before forwarding tokens to the RevenueTraders. This buffer allows collateral tokens to be periodically converted into the RToken, which is a more efficient form of revenue production than trading each individual collateral for the desired RToken.

Default value: `1e14` = 0.01%
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e12 to 1e18

### `maxTradeSlippage`

Dimension: `{1}`

The max trade slippage is a percentage value that describes the maximum deviation from oracle prices that any trade can clear at. Oracle prices have ranges of their own; the maximum trade slippage permits additional price movement beyond the worst-case oracle price.

Default value: `0.01e18` or `0.02e18` = 1/2%
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e12 to 1e18

### `shortFreeze`

Dimension: `{s}`

The number of seconds a short freeze lasts. Governance can freeze forever.

Default value: `259200` = 3 days
Mainnet reasonable range: 3600 to 2592000 (1 hour to 1 month)

### `longFreeze`

Dimension: `{s}`

The number of seconds a long freeze lasts. Long freezes can be disabled by removing all addresses from the `LONG_FREEZER` role.

Default value: `2592000` = 30 days
Mainnet reasonable range: 86400 to 31536000 (1 day to 1 year)

### `RToken Supply Throttles`

In order to restrict the system to organic patterns of behavior, we maintain two supply throttles, one for net issuance and one for net redemption. When a supply change occurs, a check is performed to ensure this does not move the supply more than an acceptable range over a period; a period is fixed to be an hour. The acceptable range (per throttle) is a function of the `amtRate` and `pctRate` variables. **It is the maximum of whichever variable provides the larger rate.**

Note the differing units: the `amtRate` variable is in terms of `{qRTok/hour}` while the `pctRate` variable is in terms of `{1/hour}`, i.e a fraction.

#### `issuanceThrottle.amtRate`

Dimension: `{qRTok/hour}`

A quantity of RToken that serves as a lower-bound for how much net issuance to allow per hour.

Must be at least 1 whole RToken, or 1e18. Can be as large as 1e48. Set it to 1e48 if you want to effectively disable the issuance throttle altogether.

Default value: `1e24` = 1,000,000 RToken
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e23 to 1e27

#### `issuanceThrottle.pctRate`

Dimension: `{1/hour}`

A fraction of the RToken supply that indicates how much net issuance to allow per hour.

Can be 0 to solely rely on `amtRate`; cannot be above 1e18.

Default value: `5e16` = 5% per hour
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e15 to 1e18 (0.1% per hour to 100% per hour)

#### `redemptionThrottle.amtRate`

Dimension: `{qRTok/hour}`

A quantity of RToken that serves as a lower-bound for how much net redemption to allow per hour.

Must be at least 1 whole RToken, or 1e18. Can be as large as 1e48. Set it to 1e48 if you want to effectively disable the redemption throttle altogether.

Default value: `1e24` = 1,000,000 RToken
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e23 to 1e27

#### `redemptionThrottle.pctRate`

Dimension: `{1/hour}`

A fraction of the RToken supply that indicates how much net redemption to allow per hour.

Can be 0 to solely rely on `amtRate`; cannot be above 1e18.

Default value: `2.5e16` = 2.5% per hour
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e15 to 1e18 (0.1% per hour to 100% per hour)

### Governance Parameters

Governance is 8 days end-to-end.

**Default values**

- Voting delay: 2 day
- Voting period: 3 days
- Execution delay: 3 days

Proposal Threshold: 0.01%
Quorum: 10% of the StRSR supply (not RSR)
