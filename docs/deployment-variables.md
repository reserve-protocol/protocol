# Deployment Parameters

### `dist` (revenue split)

The fraction of revenues that should go towards RToken holders vs stakers, as given by the relative values of `dist.rTokenDist` and `dist.rsrDist`. This can be thought of as a single variable between 0 and 100% (during deployment).

Default value: 60% to stakers and 40% to RToken holders.
Mainnet reasonable range: 0% to 100%

### `minTradeVolume`

Dimension: `{UoA}`

The minimum sized trade that can be performed, in terms of the unit of account.

Setting this too high will result in auctions happening infrequently or the RToken taking a haircut when it cannot be sure it has enough staked RSR to succeed in rebalancing at par.

Setting this too low may allow griefers to delay important auctions. The variable should be set such that donations of size `minTradeVolume` would be worth delaying trading `batchAuctionLength` seconds.

This variable should NOT be interpreted to mean that auction sizes above this value will necessarily clear. It could be the case that gas frictions are so high that auctions launched at this size are not worthy of bids.

This parameter can be set to zero.

Default value: `1e21` = $1k
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e19 to 1e23

#### `rTokenMaxTradeVolume`

Dimension: `{UoA}`

The maximum sized trade for any trade involving RToken, in terms of the unit of account. The high end of the price is applied to this variable to convert it to a token quantity.

This parameter can be set to zero.

Default value: `1e24` = $1M
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e22 to 1e27.

### `rewardRatio`

Dimension: `{1}`

The `rewardRatio` is the fraction of the current reward amount that should be handed out per second.

Default value: `573038343750` = a half life of 14 days.

Reasonable range: 1e10 to 1e13

To calculate: `ln(2) / (60*60*24*desired_days_in_half_life)`, and then multiply by 1e18.

### `unstakingDelay`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The unstaking delay is the number of seconds that all RSR unstakings must be delayed in order to account for stakers trying to frontrun defaults. It must be longer than governance cycle, and must be long enough that RSR stakers do not unstake in advance of foreseeable basket change in order to avoid being expensed for slippage.

Default value: `1209600` = 2 weeks
Mainnet reasonable range: 1 to 31536000

### `tradingDelay`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The trading delay is how many seconds should pass after the basket has been changed before a trade can be opened. In the long term this can be set to 0 after MEV searchers are firmly integrated, but at the start it may be useful to have a delay before trading in order to avoid worst-case prices.

Default value: `7200` = 2 hours
Mainnet reasonable range: 0 to 604800

### `warmupPeriod`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The warmup period is how many seconds should pass after the basket regained the SOUND status before an RToken can be issued and/or a trade can be opened.

Default value: `900` = 15 minutes
Mainnet reasonable range: 0 to 604800

### `batchAuctionLength`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The auction length is how many seconds long Gnosis EasyAuctions should be.

Default value: `900` = 15 minutes
Mainnet reasonable range: 60 to 3600

### `dutchAuctionLength`

Dimension: `{seconds}`

The dutch auction length is how many seconds long falling-price dutch auctions should be. A longer period will result in less slippage due to better price granularity, and a shorter period will result in more slippage.

In general, the dutchAuctionLength should be a multiple of the blocktime. This is not enforced at a smart-contract level.

Default value: `1800` = 30 minutes
Mainnet reasonable range: 300 to 3600

At 30 minutes, a 12-second blocktime chain would have 10.87% price drops during the first 40% of the auction, and 0.055% price drops during the second 60%.

### `backingBuffer`

Dimension: `{1}`

The backing buffer is a percentage value that describes how much overcollateralization to hold in the form of RToken. This buffer allows collateral tokens to be converted into RToken, which is a more efficient form of revenue production than trading each individual collateral for the desired RToken, and also adds a small buffer that can prevent RSR from being seized when there are small losses due to slippage during rebalancing.

Default value: `1e15` = 0.1%
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e12 to 1e18

### `maxTradeSlippage`

Dimension: `{1}`

The max trade slippage is a percentage value that describes the maximum deviation from oracle prices that any trade can clear at. Oracle prices have ranges of their own; the maximum trade slippage permits additional price movement beyond the worst-case oracle price.

Default value: `0.01e18` = 1%
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e12 to 1e18

### `shortFreeze`

Dimension: `{s}`

The number of seconds a short freeze lasts. Governance can freeze forever.

Default value: `259200` = 3 days
Mainnet reasonable range: 3600 to 2592000 (1 hour to 1 month)

### `longFreeze`

Dimension: `{s}`

The number of seconds a long freeze lasts. Long freezes can be disabled by removing all addresses from the `LONG_FREEZER` role. A long freezer has 6 charges that can be used.

Default value: `604800` = 7 days
Mainnet reasonable range: 86400 to 31536000 (1 day to 1 year)

### `withdrawalLeak`

Dimension: `{1}`

The fraction of RSR stake that should be permitted to withdraw without a refresh. When cumulative withdrawals (or a single withdrawal) exceed this fraction, gas must be paid to refresh all assets.

Setting this number larger allows unstakers to save more on gas at the cost of allowing more RSR to exit improperly prior to a default.

Default value: `5e16` = 5%
Mainnet reasonable range: 0 to 25e16 (0 to 25%)

### `RToken Supply Throttles`

In order to restrict the system to organic patterns of behavior, we maintain two supply throttles, one for net issuance and one for net redemption. When a supply change occurs, a check is performed to ensure this does not move the supply more than an acceptable range over a period; a period is fixed to be an hour. The acceptable range (per throttle) is a function of the `amtRate` and `pctRate` variables. **It is the maximum of whichever variable provides the larger rate.**

The recommended starting values (amt-rate normalized to $USD) for these parameters are as follows:
|**Parameter**|**Value**|
|-------------|---------|
|issuanceThrottle.amtRate|$250k|
|issuanceThrottle.pctRate|5%|
|redemptionThrottle.amtRate|$500k|
|redemptionThrottle.pctRate|7.5%|

Be sure to convert a $ amtRate (units of `{qUSD}`) back into RTokens (units of `{qTok}`).

Note the differing units: the `amtRate` variable is in terms of `{qRTok/hour}` while the `pctRate` variable is in terms of `{1/hour}`, i.e a fraction.

#### `issuanceThrottle.amtRate`

Dimension: `{qRTok/hour}`

A quantity of RToken that serves as a lower-bound for how much net issuance to allow per hour.

Must be at least 1 whole RToken, or 1e18. Can be as large as 1e48. Set it to 1e48 if you want to effectively disable the issuance throttle altogether.

Default value: `2.5e23` = 250,000 RToken
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e23 to 1e27

#### `issuanceThrottle.pctRate`

Dimension: `{1/hour}`

A fraction of the RToken supply that indicates how much net issuance to allow per hour.

Can be 0 to solely rely on `amtRate`; cannot be above 1e18.

Default value: `5e16` = 5% per hour
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e15 to 1e18 (0.1% per hour to 100% per hour)

#### `redemptionThrottle.amtRate`

Dimension: `{qRTok/hour}`

A quantity of RToken that serves as a lower-bound for how much net redemption to allow per hour.

Must be at least 1 whole RToken, or 1e18. Can be as large as 1e48. Set it to 1e48 if you want to effectively disable the redemption throttle altogether.

Default value: `5e23` = 500,000 RToken
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e23 to 1e27

#### `redemptionThrottle.pctRate`

Dimension: `{1/hour}`

A fraction of the RToken supply that indicates how much net redemption to allow per hour.

Can be 0 to solely rely on `amtRate`; cannot be above 1e18.

Default value: `7.5e16` = 7.5% per hour
Mainnet reasonable range: 1e15 to 1e18 (0.1% per hour to 100% per hour)
